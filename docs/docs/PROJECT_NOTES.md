# HelloStay Project Notes

## Product Vision

HelloStay is designed as a general-purpose hotel management system rather than a custom solution for a single hotel.

### Target Market

- Small hotels
- Medium hotels
- Guest houses
- Lodges
- Resorts

### Long-Term Goal

Allow hotel owners from different countries to use the same application with minimal configuration.

---

## Future Requirements

### Hotel Registration

During initial setup, the application should allow the hotel owner to register: Hotel Name, Country, Address, Contact Information, Hotel Facilities (WiFi, Restaurant, Parking, Laundry, Swimming Pool, etc.).

### Multi-Currency Support

The application should support multiple currencies based on the hotel's country (INR, USD, EUR, GBP, etc.). Planned for future implementation.

### Room Image Management

During room creation, the hotel owner should be able to: Add, Update, and Remove room images.

### Customer Identity Storage

Customer records should support storing scanned identification documents (Passport, National ID, Driving License).

### OCR-Based Customer Registration

Future versions may support automatic extraction of customer information from scanned identity documents.

### Billing System

During checkout, the application should: Generate bill automatically, Calculate charges, Produce printable invoice. Printing support should be available from within the application.

### Frontend & Desktop Requirements Converted From Previous Architecture Decisions

These requirements are no longer treated as completed frontend architecture decisions because the frontend is being rebuilt from scratch. They are preserved here as future requirements to revisit during the new React/Electron implementation.

#### Future Requirement FE-59: UI/UX Design System

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 59 (Accepted)

**Source:** Former AD 62 (Accepted)

Country/Currency selection during setup. Dynamic currency display from localStorage. Searchable room type selector with 20 presets + custom input. Inline status change in Rooms table.

#### Future Requirement FE-63: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Module Visibility

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 63 (Accepted)

Three login roles: Owner (full), Manager (Dashboard, Rooms, Inventory, Expenses), Employee (Dashboard, Rooms, Inventory). Role stored in localStorage. Sidebar filters nav items by role.

#### Future Requirement FE-64: Full Module Implementation Strategy

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 64 (Accepted)

All 10 remaining modules implemented with consistent architecture: useState + lazy initialization from localStorage, Filter/Sort → Display → Mutate → Write-back pattern, data table/card grid with sort/search/filter/pagination, Add/Edit/View modals, inline actions, stats cards.

#### Future Requirement FE-65: Bookings Module Data Model

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 65 (Accepted)

Booking stores guest info, room assignment, dates, status (Reserved/Checked In/Checked Out/Cancelled), auto-calculated total, payment tracking. Room availability validated against date conflicts.

#### Future Requirement FE-66: Guest Profile Architecture

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 66 (Accepted)

Guests as independent profiles matched to bookings at runtime by name. Card-based layout with avatar initials, stay history from bookings.

#### Future Requirement FE-67: HR & Payroll System Design

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild

#### Future Requirement FE-70: Restaurant Module Design

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 70 (Accepted)

Three tabs: Orders (status workflow), Menu (items with categories), Tables (visual status grid). Order status progression: Preparing → Ready → Served → Paid.

#### Future Requirement FE-71: Reports Module with recharts

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 71 (Accepted)

Four report types: Overview (bar + pie + KPIs), Occupancy (distribution), Revenue (line + pie), Expenses (horizontal bar). All responsive with Tooltips.

#### Future Requirement FE-72: Data Export/Import System

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 72 (Accepted)

Settings module provides JSON export/import of all localStorage data with timestamp. Blob download and FileReader upload patterns.

#### Future Requirement FE-73: Module localStorage Key Registry

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 73 (Accepted)

Every module has a dedicated localStorage key: `helloStay_hotelData`, `helloStay_rooms`, `helloStay_bookings`, `helloStay_guests`, `helloStay_employees`, `helloStay_attendance`, `helloStay_payslips`, `helloStay_expenses`, `helloStay_inventory`, `helloStay_facilityBookings`, `helloStay_facilityCharges`, `helloStay_restaurantMenu`, `helloStay_restaurantOrders`.

#### Future Requirement FE-74: Booking ↔ Room Status Synchronization

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild | **Original Date:** 2026-06-24
**Source:** Former AD 74 (Accepted)

Room status is derived from booking status. New Booking → Reserved, Checked In → Occupied, Checked Out → Cleaning, Cancelled/Deleted → Available (if no other active bookings). `syncRoomStatus()` helper atomically updates room state and localStorage.

#### Future Requirement FE-75: Role-Based Manual Room Status Overrides

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild | **Original Date:** 2026-06-24
**Source:** Former AD 75 (Accepted)

Only Owner/Manager can manually change room status to: Available, Maintenance, Cleaning. Occupied/Reserved are booking-driven only. Employee sees read-only badge.

#### Future Requirement FE-76: App Default Route — Login-First Behavior

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild | **Original Date:** 2026-06-24
**Source:** Former AD 76 (Accepted)

Root (`/`) and fallback (`*`) redirect to `/login`. Login is the mandatory entry point with explicit role selection.

#### Future Requirement FE-77: Room Edit Modal Reuse Pattern

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild | **Original Date:** 2026-06-24
**Source:** Former AD 77 (Accepted)

`AddRoomModal` accepts optional `editingRoom` prop. When provided → Edit mode with pre-filled form. `key` prop forces clean remount between add/edit modes.

#### Future Requirement FE-78: Dashboard Room Occupancy Chart Redesign — Cross-Highlight Interaction

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild | **Original Date:** 2026-06-24
**Source:** Former AD 78 (Accepted)

Donut chart + status breakdown panel with cross-highlight. Single `hoveredStatus` state links chart segments to panel rows via `fillOpacity`/CSS opacity. No floating tooltips. Empty state fallback. CSS transitions replace Framer Motion for hover effects. Reduced from ~280 to 198 lines.

#### Future Requirement FE-79: Inline Delete Confirmation Pattern

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 79 (Accepted)

Delete actions use inline Yes/No confirmation buttons replacing separate modals. Single `deletingId` state tracks which row is in confirm mode. Reducing modal fatigue for rapid operations.

#### Future Requirement FE-80: Smart Pagination Algorithm

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 80 (Accepted)

Pagination shows max 5 page buttons with sliding window. When total pages > 5, window shifts based on current page position (start, middle, end). Previous/Next buttons with disabled states at boundaries.

#### Future Requirement FE-81: useCallback + Functional State Updates Pattern

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 81 (Accepted)

Save functions use `useCallback` for referential stability. State updates use functional form (`prev => ...`) for correctness when multiple state updates are batched. This prevents stale closures in async operations.

#### Future Requirement FE-82: Currency Symbol Lookup Table

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 82 (Accepted)

Currency symbols stored in a static lookup object (`CURRENCY_SYMBOLS`) in `utils/currencies.js` for O(1) access. Supports 26+ currencies. Fallback to `₹` when currency not found or localStorage empty.

#### Future Requirement FE-83: Static Data Constants Outside Components

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 83 (Accepted)

Static data (status options, color maps, payment types, chart colors) defined as module-level constants outside components. Avoids redefinition on every render, keeps JSX clean, and centralizes configuration.

#### Future Requirement FE-84: Try/Catch JSON Parsing Safety Pattern

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 84 (Accepted)

All `localStorage.getItem()` + `JSON.parse()` calls are wrapped in try/catch with fallback to default values. Prevents app crashes from corrupt localStorage data.

#### Future Requirement FE-85: Gradient Header Pattern in Modals

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 85 (Accepted)

All modals use a gradient header section (`bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-indigo-700`) for visual hierarchy. Consistent across BookingModal, BillingModal, GuestView, and EmployeeDetail modals.

#### Future Requirement FE-86: Authentication Flow, Profile Selection & Startup Sequence

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 86 (Accepted)

The application needs a seamless and professional entry point that gracefully handles different authentication states while supporting multiple users (e.g., Owner, Manager, Employee) for a single hotel instance. The standard username/password flow was too tedious for locally saved roles.

- **Animated Splash Entry**: A new `<Splash />` component acts as the global entry point (`/`). It displays a premium animation. After 2 seconds, it provides a "Get Started" gateway button that unconditionally routes all users to the Profile Selection screen.
- **Local Profile Selection**: Instead of a traditional login form, we implemented an "Account Selection" screen similar to modern streaming services (Netflix/Hulu). Local accounts are stored in `localStorage` under `helloStay_accounts`.
- **Profile Authentication & Remember Me**: Clicking a profile does not log the user in instantly. Instead, it transitions to a Password Entry view dedicated to that specific profile. The "Remember Me" toggle (which sets `helloStay_keepLoggedIn`) is located on this specific authentication screen.
- **Session Persistence**: Session state is managed via `helloStay_session` and `helloStay_keepLoggedIn`. If successful, the user is routed to the Dashboard (or Hotel Setup if incomplete).

#### Future Requirement FE-87: V2 Features / Deferred Modules

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild
**Source:** Former AD 87 (Accepted)

To streamline the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and focus on the core booking experience, several advanced operational modules have been temporarily removed from the project and deferred to Version 2.0.
When planning Version 2.0, the following modules should be restored:

1. **Employees**: Staff records, roles, statuses.
2. **HR and Payroll**: Management of employee shifts, salaries, deductions, and performance reviews.
3. **Expenses**: A ledger for tracking hotel operational costs (electricity, maintenance) against revenue.
4. **Inventory**: Management of hotel supplies (linens, toiletries, housekeeping carts) to track usage.
5. **Manage Facilities**: Administrative module for updating, pricing, and scheduling maintenance.
6. **Restaurant**: POS integration specifically for in-house dining, table management, and room service.
7. **Reports**: Advanced analytics dashboards for revenue visualization and occupancy forecasting.

#### Future Requirement FE-88: Profiles, Permissions & Hotel Information Restructure

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild | **Original Date:** 2026-06-25
**Source:** Former AD 88 (Accepted)

Significant architectural improvements were made to identity, permissions, and initial routing:

- **Enhanced Profile Management:** Added inline "Edit Role" and "Delete Role" capabilities to both the `Login` screen and the dashboard `Profile` screen. Extended profile data to support updating credentials and assigned permissions. Prevented deletion of the final Owner profile.
- **Permission Management System:** Replaced hardcoded string roles with a flexible, array-based module permission system (e.g., `Bookings`, `Rooms`, `Settings`). The Owner manages these from the profile edit modal. `Sidebar.jsx` and `AppRoutes.jsx` (via `ProtectedRoute`) now dynamically render and protect routes based on the active session's permission array. Owners implicitly inherit `Full Access`.
- **Hotel Information Hub:** Replaced `RegisterHotel.jsx` with a dual-purpose `HotelInfo.jsx`. It sits immediately after the `Splash` screen. If unconfigured, it acts as the setup form. If configured, it acts as a read-only display hub with "Edit", "Delete", and "Proceed" actions.
- **Security & Owner Authentication:** Introduced `OwnerAuthModal`. Privileged actions—such as Editing/Deleting the Hotel, or Editing/Deleting _another_ Owner profile—now prompt for the target Owner's password. Editing/Deleting an Employee profile does not require the password prompt when initiated by an Owner, smoothing UX while maintaining strict security for administrative accounts.

#### Future Requirement FE-89: Simplified Checkout Configuration

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild | **Original Date:** 2026-06-25
**Source:** Former AD 89 (Accepted)

Based on user feedback, the fixed checkout time settings (e.g., global 11:00 AM checkout) and the associated late checkout fee automatic calculations have been removed from the application modules (`Settings`, `HotelInfo`).

- **Deferred Feature:** Fixed global checkout times are documented here for potential future addition in a V2 billing update.
- **Current Approach:** The application retains the 12hr / 24hr "Checkout Duration" setting, which dictates stay length logic. Check-in and check-out logic during Bookings continues to rely on explicitly user-selected dates and times rather than a globally enforced hour.

#### Future Requirement FE-90: Centralized Data Store as Single Source of Truth

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild | **Original Date:** 2026-06-25
**Source:** Former AD 90 (Accepted)

All cross-module data mutations now route through `frontend/src/utils/dataStore.js`. Modules no longer write directly to `localStorage` for shared entities. Exports include `SYNC_EVENT`, `triggerSync()`, `getRooms/saveRooms`, `getGuests/saveGuests`, `getBookings/saveBookings`, `createBookingWithGuest`, `updateBookingStatus`, `deleteBooking`, `deleteRoom`. Components use `get*()` for lazy state initialization and listen to `SYNC_EVENT` to re-fetch data when another module mutates it.

#### Future Requirement FE-91: Strict GuestId Referential Integrity

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild | **Original Date:** 2026-06-25
**Source:** Former AD 91 (Accepted)

Bookings store `guestId` for primary guest and `guests[].guestId` for additional guests. The Guests module matches bookings via `booking.guestId === guest.id`. A legacy fallback matches by exact `guestName + guestPhone` for pre-migration bookings. This replaces unreliable name-based matching that broke on name changes or duplicates.

#### Future Requirement FE-92: Type-Driven Occupancy Automation

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild | **Original Date:** 2026-06-25
**Source:** Former AD 92 (Accepted)

Room maxOccupancy is auto-populated from room type when creating a new room: Single→1, Double/Twin→2, Suite/Family/Deluxe→4, Triple→3, Quad→4. Implemented via `autoSetOccupancyFromRoomType()` in dataStore, triggered only on create (not edit). Guest count in BookingModal is capped to the room's `maxOccupancy`.

#### Future Requirement FE-93: Guarded Room State Transitions

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild | **Original Date:** 2026-06-25
**Source:** Former AD 93 (Accepted)

Room status is primarily derived from booking lifecycle. Manual overrides are blocked when an active Reserved or Checked In booking exists for that room. The status state machine: `Reserved → Occupied → Cleaning → Available` (with `Cancelled` as terminal state). Only the Owner can Force a room to Available via a confirmation dialog (for emergency cases like guest left without checkout).

#### Future Requirement FE-94: Unified Activity Feed

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild | **Original Date:** 2026-06-25
**Source:** Former AD 94 (Accepted)

`getGuestActivity(guestId)` in dataStore returns a sorted, combined array of booking lifecycle events and guest profile changes. Activity types: `booking_created`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `booking_cancelled`, `guest_updated`, `guest_created`. Each entry has `{ id, type, description, timestamp }`. Rendered as a timeline in the Guest View Modal's "All Activity" tab with type-specific icons and colors.

#### Future Requirement FE-95: One-Time Legacy Migration

**Status:** Future Requirement / To be implemented during frontend rebuild | **Original Date:** 2026-06-25
**Source:** Former AD 95 (Accepted)

A startup migration (`migrateLegacyBookings()`) runs once on app load, guarded by the `helloStay_migration_v1_complete` localStorage flag. It matches each booking without a `guestId` to a guest profile by exact `guestName + guestPhone` match, then writes the matched `guestId` back to the booking. The migration runs silently and is transparent to the user.

Database operations performed through SQLAlchemy sessions for centralized access, better transaction control, and industry-standard patterns.

### Backend AD 7: Separate API Layer

**Status:** Accepted

API endpoints are stored in dedicated router files per module for better organization and scalability.

### Backend AD 8: Documentation-Driven Development

**Status:** Accepted

Documentation maintained alongside development. Knowledge gained during development is preserved for future reference.

### Backend AD 9: Hotel-Level Business Settings

**Status:** Accepted (Future)

Business configuration settings (check-in time, checkout time, GST, invoice settings) will be stored in a dedicated `hotel_settings` table rather than the `rooms` or `system_info` table.

### Backend AD 10: V1 First, V2 Later Strategy

**Status:** Accepted

Prioritize completing a fully functional V1 (core functionality, complete hotel workflow) before implementing advanced architecture improvements. V2 will focus on normalization, relationships, enhanced validation, and performance optimizations.

### Backend AD 11: Room Facilities Storage

**Status:** Accepted (V1)

Room facilities stored as a comma-separated string in V1 for simplicity. A dedicated facilities table may be introduced in V2.

### Backend AD 12: Room Status Validation Strategy

**Status:** Accepted (V1)

Room status stored as a String field in V1 with allowed values: Available, Occupied, Reserved, Maintenance. Validation on frontend dropdown and API.

### Backend AD 13: Optional Maximum Occupancy

**Status:** Accepted

`max_occupancy` field is optional and nullable to accommodate hotel owners who may not define it.

### Backend AD 14: Room Status vs Reservation Availability

**Status:** Accepted

`room_status` represents current operational state only. Date-based availability is determined through reservation records.

### Backend AD 15: Upcoming Reservation Visibility

**Status:** Accepted

Future reservations are not stored in `room_status`. They are obtained from reservation records.

### Backend AD 16: Room Configuration vs Room Operations

**Status:** Accepted (V1)

Single `RoomUpdate` schema used for simplicity in V1. Room operations (status) and configuration (price, type) may be separated in V2.

### Backend AD 17: Centralized Database Session Management

**Status:** Accepted

Database sessions managed through a shared `get_db()` dependency to avoid repetitive session creation code.

### Backend AD 18: Database Session Dependency

**Status:** Accepted

Shared `get_db()` dependency uses yield/finally pattern for automatic session cleanup.

### Backend AD 19: Database Access Pattern

**Status:** Accepted

FastAPI dependency injection (`db: Session = Depends(get_db)`) replaces manual session creation per endpoint.

### Backend AD 20: Explicit Schema-to-Model Mapping

**Status:** Accepted (V1)

Explicit field mapping (`room_number=room.room_number`) used in V1 instead of `Room(**room.model_dump())` for easier learning and debugging.

### Backend AD 21: Room API Response Strategy

**Status:** Accepted

Room APIs use FastAPI `response_model` instead of manual response dictionaries for cleaner code and validation.

### Backend AD 22: Pydantic ORM Serialization

**Status:** Accepted

`model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` enables direct ORM-to-Pydantic serialization.

### Backend AD 23: Room Creation API Pattern

**Status:** Accepted

Standard pattern: Create ORM object → `db.add()` → `db.commit()` → `db.refresh()` → Return ORM object.

### Backend AD 24: Router Registration Pattern

**Status:** Accepted

Each module exports an `APIRouter` registered in `main.py` via `app.include_router()`.

### Backend AD 25: Room Number Uniqueness

**Status:** Accepted

`room_number` has a database-level UNIQUE constraint to prevent duplicates.

### Backend AD 26: Single Room Retrieval Pattern

**Status:** Accepted

`GET /rooms/{room_id}` with 404 HTTPException when room not found.

### Backend AD 27: Room Partial Update Strategy

**Status:** Accepted

Uses `model_dump(exclude_unset=True)` + `setattr()` for partial updates, preserving existing values.

### Backend AD 28: Missing Resource Handling

**Status:** Accepted

All endpoints return HTTP 404 when a requested resource does not exist (REST-compliant).

### Backend AD 29: Delete Response Strategy

**Status:** Accepted

Delete endpoints return a success message object since the resource no longer exists.

### Backend AD 30: Guest Information Storage

**Status:** Accepted

Guest table stores identity info only. Booking-related fields (room_number, check_in/out) belong to the Booking/Stay table.

### Backend AD 31: Guest Phone Number Strategy

**Status:** Accepted (V1)

Phone numbers stored as strings to support international numbers and preserve formatting. Future versions will separate country_code.

### Backend AD 32: Guest Update Strategy

**Status:** Accepted

`GuestUpdate` schemas use all-optional fields for partial updates. `GuestCreate` requires all fields.

### Backend AD 33: Migration-Based Schema Management

**Status:** Accepted

Alembic migrations manage all database schema changes to prevent data loss and keep schema synchronized with models.

### Backend AD 34: Router Prefix Pattern

**Status:** Accepted

Each router defines its own `prefix` and `tags` for cleaner routes and Swagger grouping.

### Backend AD 35: Separate Guest Identity From Room Assignment

**Status:** Accepted

Guest records store only identity information. Room assignment handled through separate occupancy/check-in logic.

### Backend AD 36: Room Occupancy Model

**Status:** Accepted

A room may contain multiple guests simultaneously (families, couples, group bookings). No one-guest-per-room restriction.

### Backend AD 37: Separate Guest Identity From Stay Records

**Status:** Accepted

Guest information and hotel stay information in separate tables. The same guest may stay multiple times.

### Backend AD 38: Stay Status Simplification

**Status:** Accepted (V1)

Stay table supports only two statuses initially: Checked In, Checked Out.

### Backend AD 39: Avoid Duplicate Room Information

**Status:** Accepted

Stay table stores `room_id` only (not `room_number`). Room data retrieved through relationship.

### Backend AD 40: Nullable Check-Out Timestamp

**Status:** Accepted

`check_out_datetime` is nullable. Active stays identified by `check_out_datetime IS NULL`.

### Backend AD 41: Store Price Snapshot In Stay Records

**Status:** Accepted

Stay table contains `price_per_night` as a snapshot at check-in time. Future room price changes do not affect historical records.

### Backend AD 42: Stay Records Preserve Historical Relationships

**Status:** Accepted

Stay table does not enforce uniqueness on `guest_id`/`room_id`. Same guest or room can appear in multiple stays.

### Backend AD 43: Introduce Stay Entity for Occupancy Tracking

**Status:** Accepted

Stay entity introduced as a transactional record linking Guest and Room with price snapshot and timestamps.

### Backend AD 44: Normalize Guest–Stay Relationship Using a Junction Table

**Status:** Accepted

`GuestStay` junction table supports multiple guests per stay and multiple stays per guest, with `is_primary_guest` flag for billing.

### Backend AD 45: Keep Direct Model Imports During Learning Phase

**Status:** Temporary

Models use direct imports during learning phase. Will refactor to `TYPE_CHECKING` strategy later.

### Backend AD 46: Resolve Model Circular Imports Using TYPE_CHECKING

**Status:** Accepted

Bidirectional relationships resolved using `from typing import TYPE_CHECKING` with forward references.

### Backend AD 47: Adopt Alembic as the Sole Database Schema Manager

**Status:** Accepted

`Base.metadata.create_all()` removed. All schema changes through Alembic migrations.

### Backend AD 48: Rebuild Initial Migration History Before Feature Development

**Status:** Accepted

Existing dev database and incomplete migration files discarded. Clean initial migration generated.

### Backend AD 49: Store Historical Stay Price Independently from Room Price

**Status:** Accepted

Stay model stores agreed nightly rate at check-in. Room model stores only current price. Small intentional duplication in exchange for accurate historical billing.

### Backend AD 50: Validate Auto-Generated Migrations Before Applying

**Status:** Accepted

Every autogenerated migration must be manually reviewed before applying to the database.

### Backend AD 51: Verify ORM Metadata Before Generating Migrations

**Status:** Accepted

Verify all expected tables are present in `Base.metadata.tables` before generating important migrations.

### Backend AD 52: Review Auto-Generated Migrations Before Database Upgrade

**Status:** Accepted

Review confirms: table creation, column definitions, primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, indexes, cascade behavior.

## Frontend Architecture Decisions

### Frontend AD 0: Backend-Contract-First Frontend Rebuild Orientation

**Status:** Accepted
**Date Recorded:** 2026-06-29
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 0 — Frontend Orientation, Backend Contract Review, and Architecture Boundary Confirmation

The HelloStay frontend rebuild begins with a backend-contract-first orientation before adding React code, Electron code, routing, authentication, dashboard, rooms, guests, stays/bookings, finance, or history.

**Decision:**
Use Milestone 0 to confirm the frontend architecture direction before implementation. The frontend must be designed from the actual FastAPI backend contracts, not from assumptions or the deleted frontend implementation.

This single architecture decision includes the following accepted decisions from Milestone 0:

- The backend API contract must drive frontend development.
- FastAPI remains the source of truth for business logic, validation, authentication, database operations, hotel workflows, and finance truth.
- React is responsible only for the renderer UI: screens, forms, components, routing, state, loading states, error states, and API calls.
- Electron is responsible only for the desktop shell: app lifecycle, BrowserWindow creation, startup flow, native OS integration, packaging, and future backend startup/checking.
- Preload/IPC should be used only for safe desktop communication between React renderer and Electron main process.
- React must not directly access SQLite, filesystem APIs, or backend internals.
- Electron must not contain room, guest, stay, booking, finance, or database business logic.
- A central API client must be used later instead of scattered `fetch()` calls.
- The future frontend structure should be feature-based.
- Authentication must not be implemented as real frontend integration until backend auth routes exist.
- The current backend term `Stay` should be used internally instead of pretending there is a complete `/bookings` API.
- The first frontend-backend integration should be the backend health check using `GET /`.
- Rooms should be built before Guests, and Guests should be built before Stays.
- Dashboard should not be implemented first because it depends on existing module data or a future backend summary endpoint.
- Finance should eventually come from backend-calculated APIs, not permanent frontend-only calculations.

**Why this decision was made:**
HelloStay is being rebuilt as a production-oriented offline desktop hotel management system. The frontend must be understandable, maintainable, and aligned with the completed backend architecture.

Starting with an orientation milestone prevents these mistakes:

- Building UI screens that do not match backend schemas.
- Creating fake API services.
- Implementing fake authentication before backend auth routes exist.
- Moving backend business rules into React.
- Moving hotel workflow logic into Electron.
- Rebuilding the deleted frontend blindly.
- Adding routing, dashboard, or modules before the foundation is clear.
- Confusing `Booking` and `Stay` while the backend currently exposes `/stay`.

This decision protects the project architecture and supports the learning goal: understanding how professional engineers plan before implementation.

**Affected files:**
No frontend source files were created or modified during this milestone.

Backend files reviewed during this milestone included:

- Backend `main.py`
- Backend room API file
- Backend guest API file
- Backend stay API file
- Backend guest-stay API file
- Backend system-info API file
- Backend security utility file
- Backend token schema file
- Backend database connection/session/base files
- Backend Room model
- Backend Guest model
- Backend Stay model
- Backend GuestStay model
- Backend SystemInfo model
- Backend Room schema
- Backend Guest schema
- Backend Stay schema
- Backend GuestStay schema
- Existing `PROJECT_NOTES.md`

**Frontend structure after cleanup:**
No frontend structure was changed during Milestone 0.

Approved future direction:
frontend/
src/
features/
startup/
rooms/
guests/
stays/
guestStays/
shared/
components/
services/
hooks/
utils/

**Accepted implementation details:**

- No implementation was performed in this milestone.
- Milestone 0 was treated as a planning, review, and architecture-boundary milestone.
- The current backend was reviewed as the source of truth.
- The currently registered backend areas were identified as:
  - Health Check
  - System Info
  - Rooms
  - Guests
  - Stays
  - Guest-Stays

- The first future frontend API integration should use:
  - `GET /`

- A future shared API client should be introduced before feature API services.
- Future API service files should be organized by feature:
  - `systemApi.js`
  - `roomsApi.js`
  - `guestsApi.js`
  - `staysApi.js`
  - `guestStaysApi.js`

- Real authentication should wait until backend authentication routes are implemented and registered.
- The frontend should use `Stay` internally because the backend currently exposes `/stay`, not `/bookings`.

**Backend contract considered:**
Current backend APIs confirmed:

Health Check:

- `GET /`

System Info:

- `GET /system-info`

Rooms:

- `POST /rooms`
- `GET /rooms`
- `GET /rooms/{room_id}`
- `PUT /rooms/{room_id}`
- `DELETE /rooms/{room_id}`

Guests:

- `POST /guests`
- `GET /guests`
- `GET /guests/{guest_id}`
- `PUT /guests/{guest_id}`
- `DELETE /guests/{guest_id}`

Stays:

- `POST /stay`
- `GET /stay`
- `GET /stay/{stay_id}`
- `PUT /stay/{stay_id}`
- `DELETE /stay/{stay_id}`

Guest-Stays:

- `POST /guest-stays`
- `GET /guest-stays`
- `GET /guest-stays/{guest_stay_id}`
- `PUT /guest-stays/{guest_stay_id}`
- `DELETE /guest-stays/{guest_stay_id}`

Backend/API gaps identified:

- No registered auth router was visible in the uploaded backend entry file.
- No confirmed register endpoint.
- No confirmed login endpoint.
- No confirmed current-user/session endpoint.
- No dashboard summary endpoint.
- No finance summary endpoint.
- No true `/bookings` API.
- No available-room search endpoint.
- No dedicated check-in/check-out workflow endpoints.

**What was intentionally not added:**

- No React code
- No Electron code
- No React Router
- No API client
- No Axios/fetch services
- No authentication UI
- No dashboard
- No rooms UI
- No guests UI
- No stays/bookings UI
- No finance/history UI
- No shared components
- No shared context/state management
- No custom hooks
- No utility modules
- No preload/IPC implementation
- No backend startup from Electron
- No desktop packaging

**Bugs/issues found and resolved:**

- No source-code bugs were fixed because Milestone 0 did not modify code.
- A major planning issue was identified: authentication utilities exist, but real auth routes were not confirmed as registered in the uploaded backend entry file.
- A naming mismatch was identified: V1 product language says “Bookings,” but the current backend exposes “Stays.”
- A sequencing issue was resolved: Dashboard, authentication, and bookings should not be the first implementation targets.
- The correct first integration was selected: Start Page plus backend health check.

**Remaining tasks:**

- Start Frontend Milestone 1 if not already completed in the active project timeline.
- Keep frontend implementation aligned with actual backend contracts.
- Add real authentication only after backend auth endpoints are available.
- Add dashboard only after enough backend data or a dashboard summary endpoint exists.
- Add finance only after backend finance support exists, or clearly mark any frontend-derived finance as temporary.
- Revisit the Booking vs Stay model when the backend supports true reservation workflows.
- Introduce a central API client before building feature-level API services.
- Keep Electron limited to desktop shell responsibilities.

**Next recommended step:**
Proceed to the next milestone in the frontend rebuild sequence.

If Frontend Milestone 1 is already completed, continue with:

Frontend Milestone 2 — Electron Desktop Shell Setup.

Keep Electron limited to desktop shell responsibilities: app lifecycle, BrowserWindow creation, secure preload planning, and renderer loading.

Do not add hotel features, routing, backend integration, authentication, dashboard, rooms, guests, stays/bookings, finance, or history during the Electron shell setup milestone.

### Frontend AD 1: Minimal React Foundation Before Features

**Status:** Accepted
**Date Recorded:** 2026-06-29
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 1 — React Project Setup

The HelloStay frontend rebuild begins with a minimal Vite + React foundation before adding hotel features, routing, backend integration, authentication, or Electron.

**Decision:**
Create a clean React frontend using Vite with JavaScript, not TypeScript. Keep the first milestone focused only on app startup, root rendering, basic global CSS, and fixed development port configuration.

**Why this decision was made:**
The frontend is being rebuilt from scratch for learning, maintainability, and production clarity. Starting with a small foundation prevents confusion and avoids mixing React setup with unrelated concerns such as routing, authentication, API services, dashboard UI, rooms, guests, bookings, or Electron. This also keeps React clearly separated as the future Electron renderer process.

**Affected files:**

- `frontend/src/main.jsx`
- `frontend/src/App.jsx`
- `frontend/src/styles/global.css`
- `frontend/vite.config.js`

**Frontend structure after cleanup:**
frontend/
src/
main.jsx
App.jsx
styles/
global.css

**Accepted implementation details:**

- `main.jsx` imports React, `createRoot`, `App.jsx`, and `./styles/global.css`.
- `App.jsx` renders a minimal HelloStay setup screen only.
- `global.css` contains only basic reset styles, typography, body layout, and temporary welcome-card styling.
- `vite.config.js` fixes the Vite dev server to port `5173` with `strictPort: true`.
- Unused Vite starter files were removed:
  - `src/App.css`
  - `src/index.css`
  - `src/assets/react.svg`
  - `src/assets/vite.svg`
  - `src/assets/hero.png`
  - empty `src/assets/` folder

**Backend contract considered:**
The backend already allows the React development origin at `http://localhost:5173`, so the frontend dev server must remain on port `5173`.

**What was intentionally not added:**

- No React Router
- No API client
- No Axios/fetch services
- No authentication UI
- No dashboard
- No rooms, guests, stays, bookings, finance, or history pages
- No Electron main/preload setup
- No backend startup from Electron
- No Tailwind or design system setup yet

**Bugs/issues found and resolved:**

- The folder review initially included `node_modules`, creating noisy output.
- Correct review command should focus on `src/` or exclude `node_modules`.
- Unused Vite starter files were identified and removed.
- No React code errors were found in reviewed files.

**Sub-decisions included in this AD:**

- Use Vite + React as the frontend foundation.
- Use JavaScript instead of TypeScript for the rebuild.
- Keep React as the future Electron renderer process.
- Configure Vite to run on port `5173`.
- Use `strictPort: true` so Vite does not silently switch ports.
- Use a minimal `src/` structure with only `main.jsx`, `App.jsx`, and `styles/global.css`.
- Use one global CSS file during the foundation milestone.
- Remove unused Vite starter files and assets.
- Do not create empty future folders until they are needed.
- Do not add React Router in Milestone 1.
- Do not add API services in Milestone 1.
- Do not add authentication in Milestone 1.
- Do not add Electron in Milestone 1.
- Do not build hotel feature modules in Milestone 1.
- Do not move backend business logic into React.

**Remaining tasks:**

- Verify `npm run dev` opens the app at `http://localhost:5173`.
- Confirm browser console has no red errors.
- Confirm Network tab shows no backend API calls during Milestone 1.
- Begin Electron setup only in Milestone 2.

**Next recommended step:**
Start Frontend Milestone 2: Electron Desktop Shell Setup. Keep Electron limited to desktop shell responsibilities: app lifecycle, BrowserWindow creation, secure preload planning, and renderer loading. Do not add hotel features, routing, backend integration, or authentication yet.

### Frontend AD 2: Electron Desktop Shell Setup

**Status:** Accepted
**Date Recorded:** 2026-06-29
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 2 — Electron Desktop Shell Setup

#### Context

HelloStay is an offline desktop Hotel Management System. The frontend was already initialized as a minimal Vite + React application in Milestone 1. The next step was to introduce Electron as the desktop shell while keeping the architecture clean and avoiding premature feature development.

Electron is responsible for desktop application behavior. React remains responsible for the user interface. FastAPI remains the source of truth for business logic, validation, database operations, authentication, and API contracts.

#### Decision

Introduce a minimal Electron shell around the existing Vite React frontend.

The Electron setup will include:

- `frontend/electron/main.js` as the Electron main process entry file.

- `frontend/electron/preload.js` as the preload script placeholder.

- A secure Electron `BrowserWindow`.

- Development loading from the Vite dev server at:
  http://localhost:5173

- A future production loading branch using the React build output.

- npm scripts for running Vite and Electron together during development.

Electron will not start the FastAPI backend yet. Electron will not contain hotel business logic. Electron will not access SQLite directly. React will not get direct Node.js access.

#### Architectural Boundaries

The application is separated into clear responsibilities:
Electron main process
Owns desktop lifecycle, BrowserWindow creation, app startup, app quit behavior.

Electron preload script
Reserved for future safe renderer-main communication.

React renderer process
Owns screens, components, forms, UI state, user interaction, and visual rendering.

FastAPI backend
Owns business logic, validation, authentication, database operations, and API contracts.

SQLite database
Owns persistent local data storage.

#### BrowserWindow Security Configuration

The Electron `BrowserWindow` must use secure defaults:

```js
webPreferences: {
  preload: path.join(__dirname, "preload.js"),
  nodeIntegration: false,
  contextIsolation: true,
}
```

`nodeIntegration` is disabled so React cannot directly use Node.js APIs.

`contextIsolation` is enabled so Electron/preload code and React renderer code remain separated.

The preload script is connected but exposes no APIs yet.

#### Development Loading Decision

During development, Electron loads the Vite React dev server:
http://localhost:5173

This allows React fast refresh and keeps frontend development simple.

The Electron main process uses a development branch to load the Vite URL and a future production branch to load the built React output from `dist/index.html`.

Production packaging is not part of this milestone.

#### npm Script Decision

The frontend package uses development scripts to run React and Electron together:

```json
"dev": "vite",
"electron": "wait-on http://localhost:5173; electron .",
"desktop": "concurrently -k \"npm run dev\" \"npm run electron\""
```

`concurrently` is used to run the Vite dev server and Electron at the same time.

`wait-on` is used so Electron starts only after the Vite dev server is available.

A PowerShell-compatible command separator is used because the local Windows PowerShell environment did not support `&&`.

#### Main Process Platform Decision

The Electron main process handles platform-specific close behavior.

On Windows and Linux, the app quits when all windows are closed.

On macOS, the app remains active until the user explicitly quits, matching normal macOS desktop behavior.

The final implementation may use an explicit Node process import:

```js
import process from "node:process";
```

and check:

```js
process.platform !== "darwin";
```

This avoids editor/tooling confusion where the global `process` object may not be recognized.

#### Preload Decision

Create `frontend/electron/preload.js`, but expose nothing during this milestone.

The preload script exists only to prepare the secure architecture for future IPC and desktop APIs.

No `contextBridge`, `ipcRenderer`, filesystem access, app version access, printing, backup, or native OS integration is added yet.

#### Why This Decision Was Made

This decision keeps the project simple, secure, and understandable.

Starting with a minimal Electron shell helps separate responsibilities clearly before adding more complexity. It prevents the common beginner mistake of mixing React UI code, Electron desktop code, backend logic, and database access in the same layer.

This also supports HelloStay’s long-term goal as an offline desktop application while preserving FastAPI as the backend source of truth.

#### Benefits

- Clear separation between desktop shell and React UI.
- Secure Electron defaults from the beginning.
- React remains simple and browser-like.
- FastAPI remains responsible for business rules and data operations.
- The app can run as a desktop window during development.
- Future preload/IPC work has a safe place to be added later.
- Packaging can be introduced later without rushing the architecture.

##### Trade-Offs

- Development now requires running both Vite and Electron.
- The app is not packaged yet.
- Electron does not yet start or manage the FastAPI backend.
- The preload file exists but does not provide functionality yet.
- The startup scripts are still development-focused and may be improved later for stronger cross-platform behavior.

These trade-offs are acceptable because Milestone 2 focuses only on the desktop shell foundation.

#### Affected Files

frontend/package.json
frontend/electron/main.js
frontend/electron/preload.js

#### Not Included In This Decision

This decision does not include:

- React Router
- Authentication
- Login flow
- Dashboard
- Rooms
- Guests
- Stays
- Bookings
- Finance
- History
- Backend API integration
- FastAPI process startup from Electron
- SQLite access from Electron
- IPC API design
- File system access
- Printing
- App packaging
- Installer setup

#### Final Outcome

HelloStay can now be launched as a desktop application during development.

The command:

```bash
npm run desktop
```

starts Vite, waits for the Vite dev server, starts Electron, creates a secure desktop window, and loads the React frontend inside it.

#### Consequence

Future milestones can now build on a clear desktop architecture:

Electron wraps the app.
React renders the UI.
Preload safely bridges future desktop APIs.
FastAPI owns business logic.
SQLite stores data.

This decision establishes the foundation for future Electron capabilities without weakening security or mixing responsibilities.

### Frontend AD 3: Startup Flow and Routing Belong to the React Renderer

**Status:** Accepted
**Date Recorded:** 2026-06-30
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 3 — Startup Flow and Routing
**Project:** HelloStay — Offline Hotel Management System

#### 1. Decision

HelloStay will handle startup flow and application routing inside the React renderer process using React Router.

The Electron main process will not manage React routes. It will only create the desktop window, manage the application lifecycle, and load the React app.

Route definitions will be stored separately in:
src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx

Page-level components will be stored in:
src/pages/

The app will start at:
/

The first milestone route structure will be:
/ → StartPage
/login → LoginPage

-          → NotFoundPage

#### 2. Context

HelloStay is an offline desktop application built with Electron, React, and FastAPI.

Electron provides the desktop shell. React provides the user interface inside Electron. FastAPI remains the source of truth for backend business logic, validation, database operations, authentication, and API contracts.

Before adding hotel features, authentication, dashboard layout, or API integration, the frontend needs a clean way to move between screens.

Routing is the mechanism that allows a single React application to show different pages based on the current URL.

#### 3. Why This Decision Was Made

This decision was made to keep the frontend architecture clean and scalable.

A production application should not keep all screens inside `App.jsx`. As the project grows, putting all page logic directly inside `App.jsx` would make the file difficult to understand and maintain.

By separating routes into `AppRoutes.jsx`, the application has a clear place for route definitions.

By separating pages into the `pages/` folder, each screen becomes easier to locate, modify, test, and extend.

This also protects the separation of responsibilities between Electron and React.

Electron should not know about routes like:
/login
/rooms
/guests
/dashboard

Those are UI-level routes and belong to React.

#### 4. Architecture Rule

The accepted architecture rule is:
React renderer owns application routing.
Electron main process owns desktop lifecycle.
FastAPI owns backend business logic and API contracts.

This means:

- React decides which page to show.
- Electron decides how the desktop window opens.
- FastAPI decides how business data is created, validated, stored, and returned.

#### 5. Chosen Approach

The chosen routing approach for Milestone 3 is `BrowserRouter`.

`BrowserRouter` was selected because:

- It is beginner-friendly.
- It works well with the Vite development server.
- It gives clean URLs.
- It is commonly used in React applications.
- It supports normal paths like `/login`.

Example:
/login

instead of:
/#/login

#### 6. Alternatives Considered

##### Alternative 1: Keep conditional rendering inside App.jsx

Example:
If current screen is "start", show StartPage.
If current screen is "login", show LoginPage.

This was rejected because it does not scale well. It also teaches a weaker architecture pattern for a production application.

##### Alternative 2: Use HashRouter

Example route:
/#/login

This can be useful in some packaged Electron applications because it avoids server fallback issues.

However, it was not chosen for this milestone because the app is currently running through Vite during development, and clean browser-style URLs are better for learning React Router basics.

HashRouter may be reconsidered later during Electron packaging if required.

##### Alternative 3: Use advanced React Router data routers

This was rejected for now because Milestone 3 has no route loaders, form actions, backend calls, or route-level data fetching.

The milestone only needs simple page navigation.

#### 7. Consequences

##### Positive Consequences

- The app now has a clean routing foundation.
- `App.jsx` remains small.
- Route definitions are easy to find.
- Page components are organized clearly.
- React renderer responsibilities are clear.
- Electron remains separated from UI routing.
- The app is ready for future login, dashboard, and feature routes.

##### Trade-Offs

Using `BrowserRouter` may require additional care later when the Electron app is packaged and loaded from production build files.

This is acceptable because Milestone 3 is focused on development-time routing and beginner-friendly learning.

The routing strategy can be revisited later during the packaging milestone if needed.

#### 8. Affected Files

The following files were added:
frontend/src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx
frontend/src/pages/StartPage.jsx
frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx
frontend/src/pages/NotFoundPage.jsx

The following files were updated:
frontend/src/main.jsx
frontend/src/App.jsx
frontend/src/styles/global.css

#### 9. What This Decision Does Not Include

This decision does not include:

- Real authentication.
- Login API integration.
- JWT storage.
- Auth context.
- Protected routes.
- Dashboard routes.
- Dashboard layout.
- Hotel feature modules.
- Backend startup from Electron.
- Electron packaging.

These will be handled in later milestones.

#### 10. Future Implications

This decision prepares the project for later milestones such as:
/login
/dashboard
/rooms
/guests
/stays
/bookings
/finance
/history
/settings

Later, authentication can introduce protected routes.

Example future structure:
Public routes:
/
/login

Protected routes:
/dashboard
/rooms
/guests
/stays
/finance

However, protected routes should only be added after real authentication and auth state are designed.

#### 11. Final Decision Summary

HelloStay will use React Router inside the React renderer process for application navigation.

Electron will not manage application routes.

FastAPI will not be involved in frontend routing.

The route definitions will live in `src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx`, and screen-level components will live in `src/pages/`.

This keeps the architecture simple, maintainable, beginner-friendly, and production-oriented.

### Frontend AD 4: UI Foundation and Reusable Component System

**Status:** Accepted
**Date Recorded:** 2026-06-30
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 4 — UI Foundation and Layout System

#### Context

HelloStay is an offline desktop Hotel Management System built with a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and Electron desktop shell.

Milestone 1 established the minimal React foundation using Vite and JavaScript.
Milestone 2 introduced Electron as the desktop shell while keeping React as the renderer process.
Milestone 3 introduced React Router and basic placeholder pages.

At this stage, the application has routing and simple pages, but it does not yet have a reusable visual foundation. Before building authentication, dashboard screens, rooms, guests, stays, bookings, finance, history, or settings, the frontend needs a small UI foundation that promotes consistency, readability, and maintainability.

#### Decision

Create a simple UI foundation using plain CSS and reusable React components.

The frontend will use:

- CSS variables for design tokens.
- A clean global CSS structure.
- Small reusable UI components.
- Simple page-level styling.
- Beginner-friendly component patterns using props, children, and className.

The following reusable UI components are introduced:

- `Button`
- `Input`
- `Card`
- `Loading`
- `ErrorMessage`

These components are placed under:

```txt
frontend/src/components/ui/
```

Existing placeholder pages may use these components lightly:

```txt
frontend/src/pages/StartPage.jsx
frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx
frontend/src/pages/NotFoundPage.jsx
```

No full dashboard shell, sidebar, topbar, protected routes, authentication, backend integration, or hotel features are introduced in this milestone.

#### Architecture Decision

The frontend will begin with a small custom design system instead of using Tailwind CSS, icon libraries, animation libraries, or third-party UI component libraries.

Styling remains inside the React renderer layer. Electron will not contain UI component logic.

The responsibility split remains:

```txt
FastAPI backend
  Business logic, validation, authentication rules, database operations, API contracts

Electron main process
  Desktop window, app lifecycle, native shell behavior

Electron preload layer
  Safe renderer-main communication when needed

React renderer process
  Pages, components, forms, routing, UI state, styling
```

#### Why This Decision Was Made

A reusable UI foundation prevents duplicated styles and inconsistent interface patterns as the application grows.

HelloStay will eventually contain many screens such as login, dashboard, room management, guest management, stay management, finance, history, and settings. These screens will repeatedly need buttons, inputs, cards, loading states, and error messages.

Creating these reusable pieces early helps the project stay organized without prematurely building full business features.

Plain CSS is intentionally chosen for this milestone because it helps build strong fundamentals before introducing additional styling tools. Since the project is being built for learning and production-quality engineering, the priority is to understand how UI systems work from first principles.

#### What This Decision Allows

This decision allows future pages to use consistent components such as:

```jsx
<Button>Save</Button>
<Input label="Username" />
<Card>...</Card>
<Loading message="Loading rooms..." />
<ErrorMessage message="Something went wrong." />
```

It also creates a stable place for design tokens such as:

```css
--color-primary
--color-bg
--color-surface
--color-border
--radius-md
--space-md
```

This keeps styling centralized and reduces repeated hard-coded values.

#### What This Decision Prevents

This decision prevents:

- Duplicating button styles across pages.
- Duplicating input markup across forms.
- Mixing page-level components with reusable UI components.
- Adding dashboard layout too early.
- Adding authentication before the visual foundation exists.
- Moving UI logic into Electron.
- Introducing styling libraries before understanding CSS fundamentals.
- Creating hotel-specific components before generic UI foundations are stable.

#### Affected Files

New files:

```txt
frontend/src/components/ui/Button.jsx
frontend/src/components/ui/Input.jsx
frontend/src/components/ui/Card.jsx
frontend/src/components/ui/Loading.jsx
frontend/src/components/ui/ErrorMessage.jsx
```

Modified files:

```txt
frontend/src/styles/global.css
frontend/src/pages/StartPage.jsx
frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx
frontend/src/pages/NotFoundPage.jsx
```

Unchanged responsibilities:

```txt
frontend/electron/
backend/
frontend/src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx
```

#### Implementation Direction

The UI foundation should remain small and readable.

The global stylesheet should contain:

```txt
1. CSS variables
2. base reset
3. body styling
4. page helper classes
5. reusable UI component classes
```

The UI components should be simple functional React components.

The components should accept props only where useful. Examples:

```txt
Button:
  children
  variant
  type
  disabled
  className

Input:
  label
  error
  helperText
  id
  className

Card:
  children
  className

Loading:
  message

ErrorMessage:
  message
```

#### Design System Direction

The design system is intentionally minimal.

It includes:

- Primary color
- Background color
- Surface color
- Text color
- Muted text color
- Border color
- Error color
- Border radius values
- Spacing values
- Box shadows
- Base font family

This is enough for the current milestone.

The design system should grow only when future screens reveal real repeated needs.

#### Electron Boundary

No Electron files should be changed for this milestone.

Electron’s role remains limited to the desktop shell. React owns the visual interface.

The Electron main process must not create React components, HTML forms, login UI, buttons, page layout, or CSS styling.

If future desktop-native features are required, they should go through a secure preload and IPC boundary. That is not needed in this milestone.

#### Backend Boundary

No backend endpoints are consumed in this milestone.

Although the FastAPI backend already contains endpoints for rooms, guests, stays, guest-stays, and system info, Milestone 4 does not connect to them.

The backend remains the future source of truth for:

- Business rules
- Validation
- Authentication
- Database access
- API contracts

#### Consequences

Positive consequences:

- The UI becomes more consistent.
- Future pages become easier to build.
- Basic visual tokens are centralized.
- Components are easier to reuse.
- The project remains beginner-friendly.
- The React renderer stays cleanly separated from Electron.
- The app avoids unnecessary dependencies.

Trade-offs:

- Plain CSS requires discipline as the project grows.
- The design system is basic and not visually complete yet.
- Some temporary layout spacing may still exist in placeholder pages.
- More advanced UI patterns are intentionally delayed.

#### Rejected Alternatives

##### Tailwind CSS

Rejected for this milestone.

Tailwind can be useful later, but introducing it now would add another tool before the core React and CSS fundamentals are clear.

##### UI Component Library

Rejected for this milestone.

Libraries such as Material UI, Ant Design, or Chakra UI provide many ready-made components, but they reduce the opportunity to learn reusable component design from first principles.

##### Full Dashboard Layout

Rejected for this milestone.

A dashboard layout requires authentication flow, protected routes, navigation structure, and real app sections. That belongs in a later milestone.

##### Feature-Specific Components

Rejected for this milestone.

Components such as `RoomCard`, `GuestTable`, `BookingForm`, and `FinanceWidget` are not created yet because hotel features are not part of Milestone 4.

#### Final Decision

HelloStay will use a small custom UI foundation built with plain CSS and reusable React components.

This foundation belongs entirely to the React renderer process and will support future frontend milestones without introducing unnecessary complexity or dependencies.

The accepted reusable UI components for this milestone are:

```txt
Button
Input
Card
Loading
ErrorMessage
```

This decision keeps the project simple, understandable, production-oriented, and aligned with the learning goal of rebuilding the frontend from first principles.

### Frontend AD 5: Centralized API Client and Backend Communication Boundary

**Status:** Accepted
**Date Recorded:** 2026-06-30
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 5 — API Client and Backend Communication

#### Decision

HelloStay frontend will use a centralized API communication layer instead of placing API calls directly inside React page components.

A dedicated `services` folder was introduced in the React renderer process:

```txt
frontend/src/services/
  apiClient.js
  systemService.js
```

`apiClient.js` is responsible for shared HTTP request behavior, including:

```txt
API base URL handling
request method handling
request headers
safe JSON parsing
basic error handling
network failure handling
future token attachment location
```

`systemService.js` was introduced as a minimal safe service for backend communication testing only. It calls safe backend endpoints such as `/` and `/system-info`, not hotel feature workflows.

#### Why This Decision Was Made

The frontend must not scatter raw `fetch()` calls across pages and components.

Scattered API calls create problems such as:

```txt
duplicated backend URLs
inconsistent error handling
repeated JSON parsing logic
unclear loading/error behavior
difficulty adding authentication tokens later
harder maintenance as rooms, guests, stays, finance, and history grow
```

A centralized API client creates one predictable boundary between React and FastAPI.

The React renderer owns frontend API communication, while FastAPI remains the source of truth for business logic, validation, database operations, and API contracts.

Electron remains responsible for desktop shell concerns only. Electron main process must not contain hotel API service logic.

#### Accepted Communication Flow

```txt
React page/component
  ↓
domain service file
  ↓
apiClient.js
  ↓
FastAPI backend
  ↓
SQLite/database layer
```

For Milestone 5, the tested flow was:

```txt
LoginPage temporary test UI
  ↓
systemService.js
  ↓
apiClient.js
  ↓
FastAPI / and /system-info endpoints
```

#### API Base URL Decision

The development API base URL is defined through a Vite environment variable:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

This keeps backend location configuration outside page components.

A fallback default may exist in `apiClient.js` for development safety:

```js
const DEFAULT_API_BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000";
```

Vite environment variables exposed to the browser must begin with `VITE_`.

#### Fetch vs Axios Decision

The frontend will use the browser-native `fetch()` API for this milestone.

Reason:

```txt
no extra dependency
better beginner learning value
clearer understanding of HTTP, JSON, headers, responses, and errors
sufficient for current needs
```

Axios may be reconsidered later if the project needs interceptors, advanced request cancellation, or more complex HTTP behavior.

#### Error Handling Decision

The API client will distinguish between:

```txt
network errors
backend errors
```

Network errors happen when the frontend cannot reach the backend at all.

Examples:

```txt
backend server is not running
wrong port
wrong API base URL
connection refused
```

Backend errors happen when FastAPI responds with an error status code.

Examples:

```txt
404 Not Found
422 Validation Error
500 Internal Server Error
```

The API client will throw a consistent custom error object so future screens can show reliable user-facing messages.

#### JSON Parsing Decision

The API client will not assume every backend response always contains JSON.

It will safely handle:

```txt
JSON responses
empty 204 responses
plain text responses
invalid or empty response bodies
```

This prevents frontend crashes caused by unsafe `response.json()` usage.

#### Authentication Preparation Decision

The API client contains a future token attachment location, but real authentication token logic is intentionally not implemented in this milestone.

This preserves milestone boundaries.

Future authentication can attach tokens from one centralized location instead of modifying every service or page.

#### Temporary UI Decision

A temporary backend connection test was added to the login page only for Milestone 5 verification.

The temporary test confirmed that React can successfully call:

```txt
/
 /system-info
```

through the service layer.

After verification, the temporary UI should be removed from the user-facing login page.

The files `apiClient.js`, `systemService.js`, and `.env.development` should remain.

#### Affected Files

```txt
frontend/.env.development
frontend/src/services/apiClient.js
frontend/src/services/systemService.js
frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx
```

`LoginPage.jsx` was affected only temporarily for testing.

#### Boundaries Confirmed

The following boundaries are accepted:

```txt
React renderer:
  UI, user interaction, API service calls

services/apiClient.js:
  shared frontend HTTP behavior

services/systemService.js:
  safe backend system/health communication

Electron main process:
  desktop shell, BrowserWindow, app lifecycle

FastAPI backend:
  business logic, validation, database operations, API contracts
```

#### Explicit Non-Decisions

The following were intentionally not implemented in Milestone 5:

```txt
real authentication
token storage
protected routes
dashboard layout
room service
guest service
stay service
booking workflow
finance/history services
Electron backend startup
application packaging
```

#### Result

Milestone 5 established the official frontend API communication foundation for HelloStay.

Future feature modules must use service files and the centralized API client instead of direct page-level API calls.

### Frontend AD 6: Authentication UI Foundation Before Real Auth Integration

**Status:** Accepted
**Date Recorded:** 2026-06-30
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 6 — Authentication UI Foundation

#### Decision

The HelloStay frontend will build the authentication UI foundation before implementing real authentication behavior.

Milestone 6 introduces real login and registration form interfaces using React controlled components, form validation, loading states, error states, and a dedicated `authService.js` service boundary. However, the frontend will not perform real login, real registration, dashboard redirect, token persistence, protected routing, or global authentication state until the backend exposes and confirms actual authentication endpoints.

#### Context

HelloStay V1 requires a clean startup and authentication flow:

1. User opens the app.
2. User sees the start page.
3. User navigates to login.
4. User can log in with username and password.
5. User can create a new account.
6. After real authentication is implemented, the user should enter the main dashboard.

At this milestone, the backend contains JWT/password helper functionality and token schemas, but the available FastAPI router registration does not show confirmed auth endpoints such as login, register, me, or logout. Therefore, the frontend must not invent endpoint paths or fake successful authentication.

#### Why This Decision Was Made

Authentication is a security-sensitive workflow. The frontend must not decide whether a username and password are correct. Credential verification belongs to the backend because the backend owns password hashing, database lookup, validation, JWT creation, and API contracts.

Building fake authentication in React would create the wrong architecture and may lead to unsafe habits such as:

- Hardcoding fake users.
- Redirecting to dashboard without real verification.
- Treating React state as the source of truth for identity.
- Storing fake tokens.
- Adding protected routes before real auth state exists.
- Inventing backend endpoint paths that may later conflict with the real API.

This milestone keeps the UI work productive while preserving backend authority.

#### Final Decision

For Milestone 6:

- Build a real `LoginPage` UI form.
- Build a real `RegisterPage` UI form.
- Use controlled React inputs.
- Use `useState` for form values, field errors, form error, and loading state.
- Add basic frontend validation for required fields.
- Add password confirmation validation on the registration page.
- Use existing reusable UI components.
- Create `authService.js` as the dedicated authentication service layer.
- Keep `authService.js` prepared for future login/register calls.
- Do not invent endpoint paths.
- Do not hardcode fake users.
- Do not redirect to dashboard after login.
- Do not create `ProtectedRoute`.
- Do not create global auth context yet.
- Do not persist tokens yet.
- Do not move authentication logic into Electron.

#### Affected Files

```text
frontend/src/services/authService.js
frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx
frontend/src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx
frontend/src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx
frontend/src/styles/global.css
frontend/src/components/ui/Input.jsx
frontend/src/components/ui/Button.jsx
```

#### Responsibility Separation

#### React Renderer

React handles:

- Login form UI.
- Register form UI.
- Controlled input state.
- Frontend validation.
- Submit handling.
- Loading and error display.
- Calling `authService.js`.

#### Service Layer

`authService.js` handles:

- Authentication-related frontend API boundary.
- Login function placeholder.
- Register function placeholder.
- Clear errors when auth endpoints are not confirmed.
- Future integration with `apiClient.js`.

#### FastAPI Backend

FastAPI remains responsible for:

- User lookup.
- Password hashing.
- Password verification.
- JWT creation.
- Request validation.
- Response contract.
- Auth route ownership.

#### Electron Main Process

Electron does not handle:

- Username/password form logic.
- Authentication validation.
- JWT creation.
- Hotel business rules.
- Dashboard authorization.

Electron remains responsible only for desktop shell responsibilities such as app lifecycle, window creation, safe preload exposure, packaging, and future backend startup behavior.

#### Implementation Outcome

Milestone 6 produced a clean authentication UI foundation without pretending that real auth exists.

The login page now behaves like a real form but stops at the correct boundary when no confirmed backend login endpoint exists.

The register page supports the V1 account creation direction but does not create fake accounts.

The service layer now provides a dedicated place for future auth API integration.

#### Consequences

##### Positive Consequences

- Authentication UI is now ready for future backend integration.
- Login and registration forms are beginner-friendly and production-oriented.
- Form behavior is predictable because controlled components are used.
- Page components remain clean because API responsibility is moved to `authService.js`.
- The project avoids fake authentication.
- Future Milestone 7 can focus on auth contract, token strategy, auth context, and protected routes.

##### Trade-Offs

- Login does not yet succeed.
- Register does not yet create an account.
- There is no dashboard redirect yet.
- The user sees an expected “auth endpoint not confirmed” style error after valid form submission.
- More backend verification/design is needed before real authentication can be completed.

These trade-offs are accepted because they preserve architectural correctness.

#### Explicitly Deferred

The following are intentionally postponed:

- Real login API call.
- Real register API call.
- Auth endpoint path selection.
- Token storage.
- AuthContext.
- ProtectedRoute.
- Dashboard redirect after login.
- Current user restore flow.
- Logout behavior.
- Role-based authorization.
- Electron-based secure token storage strategy.

#### Future Milestone Dependency

Milestone 7 should build on this decision by verifying or designing the backend authentication contract.

Milestone 7 should answer:

- What is the register endpoint?
- What is the login endpoint?
- What request body does login expect?
- What response body does login return?
- Does the backend return `access_token` and `token_type`?
- Is there a `/me` endpoint?
- How should the frontend restore the current user?
- Where should the token be stored?
- How should logout work?
- When should protected routes be introduced?

#### Final Rule

React may collect credentials and send them through the service layer, but React must never be the source of truth for whether credentials are correct.

FastAPI remains the authentication authority.

### Frontend AD 7: Auth State and Protected Route Foundation

**Status:** Accepted
**Date Recorded:** 2026-07-01
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 7 — Auth State and Protected Routes

#### Context

HelloStay requires a clear authentication foundation before building the real dashboard and hotel modules. The application needs a way to know whether a user is authenticated, protect private routes, redirect unauthenticated users to the login page, and support logout behavior.

At this stage, the frontend authentication UI exists, but real backend authentication is not fully confirmed from the currently available backend files. The backend contains JWT/password utility foundations and token schemas, but no registered authentication router or confirmed login endpoint is currently visible in `main.py`.

#### Decision

Use React Context to manage global frontend authentication state and create a dedicated `ProtectedRoute` component to guard private frontend routes.

Authentication state will be handled in the React renderer process, not in Electron main process. The frontend will store only temporary session/token data needed for the logged-in session. Hotel business data such as rooms, guests, stays, bookings, finance, and history must not be stored in browser storage.

A temporary protected route, `/dashboard`, will be added only to verify route protection. This is not the real dashboard shell.

#### Accepted Implementation Direction

The following files are introduced or updated:

```txt
frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx
frontend/src/routes/ProtectedRoute.jsx
frontend/src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx
frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx
frontend/src/pages/DashboardPlaceholderPage.jsx
frontend/src/services/authService.js
frontend/src/main.jsx
```

#### Key Decisions

1. **React Context is used for auth state**

   Auth state must be shared across multiple parts of the app, including login page, protected routes, future dashboard, and future logout controls. Keeping auth state only inside `LoginPage.jsx` would make the state local and unavailable to the rest of the application.

2. **`AuthProvider` wraps the application**

   `AuthProvider` is placed high enough in the component tree so route components and pages can access authentication state using a custom `useAuth()` hook.

3. **`ProtectedRoute` handles private route guarding**

   Private routes are wrapped with `ProtectedRoute`. If the user is not authenticated, the component redirects to `/login`. If the user is authenticated, it renders the protected page.

4. **Frontend guards are not treated as backend security**

   `ProtectedRoute` improves frontend navigation and user experience, but it does not secure backend data. FastAPI must still validate tokens and protect private APIs.

5. **Session/token data may be stored temporarily**

   For V1, frontend session/token data may be stored using `sessionStorage` as a simple beginner-friendly strategy. This allows refresh survival during the current session while avoiding long-term persistence.

6. **Hotel business data must not be stored in frontend storage**

   Rooms, guests, stays, bookings, finance, income, and history remain backend/database responsibilities. FastAPI and SQLite remain the source of truth.

7. **No fake production authentication**

   Because a confirmed backend login endpoint is not currently available, the frontend must not invent endpoint names, request bodies, response bodies, fake users, or fake production tokens.

8. **Electron does not manage auth form state**

   Electron main process remains responsible for desktop shell concerns only: app lifecycle, windows, startup behavior, and later packaging. React renderer handles auth UI and frontend auth state. FastAPI handles credential validation and token creation.

#### Why This Decision Was Made

This decision keeps the frontend architecture clean and prepares the app for real authentication without coupling the UI to unconfirmed backend contracts.

It also teaches a professional separation of responsibility:

```txt
React renderer:
- login form
- auth UI state
- global frontend auth state
- protected route behavior

FastAPI backend:
- credential validation
- password verification
- JWT creation
- private API protection

Electron main process:
- desktop window
- app lifecycle
- startup behavior
- packaging later
```

#### Consequences

Positive consequences:

```txt
Auth state is centralized.
Protected routing is reusable.
LoginPage stays focused on form behavior.
Future dashboard can depend on a clean auth foundation.
The frontend does not fake backend behavior.
Electron responsibilities remain cleanly separated.
```

Trade-offs:

```txt
Real login success flow cannot be fully tested until the backend exposes a confirmed auth endpoint.
Authenticated access to private routes remains blocked without a real token.
Role-based permissions are intentionally postponed.
```

#### Deferred Work

The following items are intentionally postponed:

```txt
Real backend login integration
Register endpoint integration
Token verification on app startup
Refresh token handling
Role-based permissions
Real dashboard shell
Sidebar navigation
Rooms module
Guests module
Stays/bookings module
Finance/history module
Electron backend startup
Electron secure token storage
Packaging
```

#### Final Decision Summary

HelloStay will use React Context for global frontend authentication state and a reusable `ProtectedRoute` component for route guarding. This milestone establishes the frontend structure for authentication while avoiding fake production login until the FastAPI auth endpoint contract is confirmed.

### Frontend AD 8: Protected Dashboard Shell with Nested Module Navigation

**Status:** Accepted
**Date Recorded:** 2026-07-01
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 8 — Dashboard Layout and Navigation

**Decision:**
HelloStay will use a protected dashboard application shell built in React using React Router nested routes.

The dashboard shell will be implemented as a layout component:

```txt
src/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx
```

This layout is responsible for the common dashboard structure:

```txt
Sidebar navigation
Top header
Main content area
Logout button
React Router Outlet
```

The dashboard pages will be rendered inside the layout using React Router’s `Outlet`.

**Route Structure Decision:**
Dashboard routes will be grouped under a common parent route:

```txt
/dashboard
/dashboard/rooms
/dashboard/guests
/dashboard/stays
/dashboard/finance
/dashboard/history
```

The `/dashboard` route renders the dashboard layout. The child routes render placeholder pages inside the layout.

```txt
/dashboard          → DashboardHome
/dashboard/rooms    → RoomsPage
/dashboard/guests   → GuestsPage
/dashboard/stays    → StaysPage
/dashboard/finance  → FinancePage
/dashboard/history  → HistoryPage
```

**Protected Route Decision:**
The existing `ProtectedRoute` will protect the dashboard parent route.

This means all dashboard child routes are protected automatically.

Accepted route structure:

```jsx
<Route
  path="/dashboard"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <DashboardLayout />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
>
  <Route index element={<DashboardHome />} />
  <Route path="rooms" element={<RoomsPage />} />
  <Route path="guests" element={<GuestsPage />} />
  <Route path="stays" element={<StaysPage />} />
  <Route path="finance" element={<FinancePage />} />
  <Route path="history" element={<HistoryPage />} />
</Route>
```

This avoids repeating `ProtectedRoute` around every dashboard page.

**Layout Responsibility Decision:**
The sidebar, header, and main dashboard frame belong in `DashboardLayout.jsx`.

They should not be duplicated inside every dashboard page.

Accepted structure:

```txt
DashboardLayout
├── Sidebar
├── Top Header
└── Outlet
    ├── DashboardHome
    ├── RoomsPage
    ├── GuestsPage
    ├── StaysPage
    ├── FinancePage
    └── HistoryPage
```

This keeps the application shell stable while only the inner page content changes.

**Navigation Decision:**
Sidebar navigation will use `NavLink` from React Router.

`NavLink` was chosen instead of `Link` because it supports active route styling.

```txt
Link     → navigation only
NavLink  → navigation + active route awareness
```

The dashboard home link uses `end: true` so it is active only on `/dashboard`, not on child routes like `/dashboard/rooms`.

**Placeholder Page Decision:**
Milestone 8 creates placeholder pages only.

Created placeholder pages:

```txt
DashboardHome.jsx
RoomsPage.jsx
GuestsPage.jsx
StaysPage.jsx
FinancePage.jsx
HistoryPage.jsx
```

These pages do not contain real feature logic yet.

No API calls, tables, forms, modals, charts, search, filters, CRUD logic, finance calculations, or history workflows were added.

This keeps Milestone 8 focused only on layout and navigation.

**Electron Boundary Decision:**
Dashboard routing and dashboard UI belong in the React renderer process.

Electron should not control dashboard pages, sidebar links, React routes, or hotel module navigation.

Electron remains responsible for:

```txt
Desktop shell
BrowserWindow
App lifecycle
Preload security
Native desktop integration
Future packaging
```

React remains responsible for:

```txt
Routes
Pages
Layouts
Sidebar navigation
Header UI
Protected dashboard rendering
Logout interaction
```

**Backend Boundary Decision:**
FastAPI remains the source of truth for hotel business logic, validation, database operations, and API contracts.

Milestone 8 does not call backend endpoints for rooms, guests, stays, finance, or history.

The dashboard pages are placeholders only. Real backend integration will happen in future milestones.

**Authentication Development Decision:**
Real backend authentication is not implemented yet.

Because the backend login/register endpoints are not currently available, temporary frontend-only authentication mocks were accepted in `authService.js`.

These mocks exist only to test:

```txt
Login UI flow
Register UI flow
Auth state
ProtectedRoute behavior
Dashboard access
Logout behavior
```

These mocks are not production authentication and must be removed when real FastAPI authentication endpoints are implemented.

**Auth File Organization Decision:**
Authentication context code was split into separate files to avoid React Fast Refresh errors and improve separation of responsibilities.

Accepted structure:

```txt
src/context/AuthContext.js
src/context/AuthProvider.jsx
src/hooks/useAuth.js
```

Responsibilities:

```txt
AuthContext.js       → creates and exports AuthContext only
AuthProvider.jsx     → stores token, login, logout, and auth state
useAuth.js           → exposes reusable useAuth hook
```

The old combined file was removed from active use:

```txt
src/context/AuthContext.jsx
```

This avoids the `react-refresh/only-export-components` ESLint warning.

**Final Decision Summary:**
Milestone 8 establishes the protected dashboard shell for HelloStay.

The application now has a scalable dashboard layout that can host future modules such as rooms, guests, stays, finance, and history.

No real hotel feature logic was added in this milestone.

### Frontend AD 9 — Rooms Read-Only Data Fetching Through Service Layer

**Status:** Accepted
**Date Recorded:** 2026-07-02
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 9 — Rooms Module Read-Only Foundation
**Project:** HelloStay — Offline Hotel Management System

#### Decision

The HelloStay frontend will fetch room data through a dedicated room service file instead of calling the backend directly from `RoomsPage.jsx`.

A new service file was introduced:

```txt
frontend/src/services/roomService.js
```

This service contains a `getRooms` function that calls the backend `GET /rooms` endpoint through the existing shared `apiClient.js`.

The Rooms page uses this service function to load and display room data in a read-only format.

#### Reason for the Decision

Rooms is the first real hotel module connected to backend data.

Because of that, it is important to establish a clean frontend pattern before adding more complex workflows.

Calling the backend directly inside `RoomsPage.jsx` would mix UI logic and API communication logic in the same file. That may look simple at first, but it becomes harder to maintain as the application grows.

Using a service layer keeps responsibilities clear:

```txt
RoomsPage.jsx
- displays UI
- manages loading, error, empty, and success states
- calls getRooms()

roomService.js
- owns room-related API functions
- knows that rooms are fetched from /rooms

apiClient.js
- owns common request logic
- owns base URL handling
- owns shared error and response handling

FastAPI backend
- owns validation
- owns business rules
- owns database operations
- owns the room API contract
```

This pattern supports future growth when more room functions are added, such as create, edit, delete, and status update.

#### Architecture Rule Established

Frontend feature modules should not call raw backend endpoints directly from page components.

Instead, API calls should flow through feature-specific service files.

For the Rooms module, the rule is:

```txt
RoomsPage.jsx must call roomService.js.
roomService.js must call apiClient.js.
apiClient.js must communicate with FastAPI.
```

#### Data Flow

```txt
RoomsPage.jsx
  ↓
getRooms()
  ↓
roomService.js
  ↓
apiRequest("/rooms")
  ↓
apiClient.js
  ↓
FastAPI GET /rooms
  ↓
SQLite database
```

#### Why Read-Only First

The Rooms module starts with read-only functionality because reading data is safer and simpler than modifying data.

The frontend must first prove that it can:

```txt
Connect to the backend
Handle API responses
Render backend data
Handle loading states
Handle errors
Handle empty results
Keep UI readable
```

Only after this foundation is stable should the module add write operations such as create, edit, and delete.

This reduces complexity and avoids mixing too many concepts in one milestone.

#### React State Decision

`RoomsPage.jsx` manages three local states:

```js
rooms;
isLoading;
error;
```

This decision keeps the module simple.

Global state is not needed yet because room data is only used inside the Rooms page in this milestone.

A custom hook such as `useRooms()` was intentionally not introduced yet because the logic is still small and beginner-friendly.

#### useEffect Decision

`useEffect` is used to fetch rooms when the `RoomsPage` component loads.

This is appropriate because fetching room data is a side effect.

The effect uses an inner async function instead of making the `useEffect` callback directly async.

Accepted pattern:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  async function loadRooms() {
    // fetch rooms here
  }

  loadRooms();
}, []);
```

Rejected pattern:

```js
useEffect(async () => {
  // do not do this
}, []);
```

The rejected pattern is avoided because React expects the effect callback to return either nothing or a cleanup function, not a Promise.

#### UI State Decision

The Rooms page must handle four UI states:

```txt
Loading
Error
Empty
Success
```

This is accepted as the standard pattern for future backend-connected pages in HelloStay.

A production-quality page should not assume that data will always load successfully.

#### Electron Responsibility Decision

No room data fetching logic should be added to the Electron main process or preload layer.

Electron is responsible for:

```txt
Desktop shell
Application lifecycle
Native window
Safe desktop integration
Future packaging
```

React is responsible for:

```txt
Screens
Components
User interaction
Calling frontend services
Displaying API data
```

FastAPI is responsible for:

```txt
Room business logic
Validation
Database queries
API contracts
```

Therefore, room API calls belong in the React renderer process service layer, not in Electron.

#### Backend Source of Truth Decision

FastAPI remains the source of truth for room data.

The frontend must not use `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` as the source of truth for rooms.

The frontend may temporarily store fetched room data in React state for rendering, but the actual room records come from the backend database through `GET /rooms`.

#### Affected Files

```txt
frontend/src/services/roomService.js
frontend/src/pages/RoomsPage.jsx
frontend/src/styles/global.css
```

#### Not Included in This Decision

This architecture decision does not cover:

```txt
Creating rooms
Editing rooms
Deleting rooms
Room forms
Room modals
Room status update
Room availability calculation
Room filtering
Room sorting
Room pagination
Booking integration
Stay integration
Finance integration
History integration
```

These will be handled in later milestones.

#### Consequences

This decision creates a clean and repeatable pattern for future modules.

The same structure can later be used for:

```txt
guestService.js
stayService.js
financeService.js
historyService.js
```

It also makes the Rooms module easier to expand because new room API functions can be added to `roomService.js` without making `RoomsPage.jsx` messy.

#### Final Decision Summary

HelloStay accepts a service-layer-based approach for room data fetching.

For Milestone 9, the Rooms page reads room records from FastAPI through `roomService.js` and `apiClient.js`, displays them in a read-only UI, and handles loading, error, empty, and success states.

This decision keeps the frontend modular, beginner-friendly, production-oriented, and aligned with the project rule that FastAPI remains the source of truth.

### Frontend AD 10: Rooms Module Create Foundation Through Service Layer

**Status:** Accepted
**Date Recorded:** 2026-07-03
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 10 — Rooms Module Create Foundation

HelloStay now supports creating room records from the React frontend while keeping FastAPI as the source of truth for validation, persistence, and room data.

**Decision:**
Add room creation to the existing Rooms module by introducing a `createRoom()` function inside `roomService.js` and connecting it to an inline controlled form inside `RoomsPage.jsx`.

The frontend sends new room data to the backend using `POST /rooms` through the existing API client and service layer. After successful creation, the frontend clears the form and refreshes the room list from the backend.

**Why this decision was made:**
Milestone 9 introduced read-only room listing using `GET /rooms`. Creating rooms is the next natural step because the user can now move from viewing backend records to creating real backend records.

Room creation was implemented only after the read-only foundation because write operations require more frontend responsibility:

- controlled form fields
- form state
- submit handling
- frontend validation
- loading state
- error state
- request payload preparation
- backend persistence verification
- list refresh after successful creation

Keeping this milestone focused only on creation avoids mixing too many concepts at once.

**Architecture reasoning:**
Room creation belongs in the React renderer UI and the frontend service layer, not in Electron and not in local storage.

React is responsible for:

- displaying the room creation form
- storing temporary form input in component state
- validating basic user input before submission
- calling the room service
- showing loading and error feedback
- refreshing the UI after creation

`roomService.js` is responsible for:

- exposing a clear `createRoom(roomData)` function
- keeping room API calls in one place
- using the existing `apiClient.js`

FastAPI remains responsible for:

- validating request data
- enforcing backend rules
- writing room records to SQLite
- returning the saved room data

Electron remains responsible only for desktop shell behavior and does not contain room API logic.

**Affected files:**

- `frontend/src/services/roomService.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/RoomsPage.jsx`
- `frontend/src/styles/global.css` if styling additions were needed

**Implementation summary:**
`roomService.js` was updated to include:

```js
export function createRoom(roomData) {
  return apiRequest("/rooms", {
    method: "POST",
    body: roomData,
  });
}
```

`RoomsPage.jsx` was updated with:

- `initialRoomFormData`
- `formData` state
- `isCreating` state
- `createError` state
- controlled form inputs
- `handleInputChange`
- `validateRoomForm`
- `handleCreateRoom`
- room list refresh after successful creation

**Validation decision:**
Basic frontend validation was added before submitting the form:

- `room_number` is required
- `price_per_night` is required
- `price_per_night` must be a positive number
- `room_status` is required
- `max_occupancy` must be a positive whole number if provided

Frontend validation improves user experience, but it does not replace backend validation. FastAPI and the database remain the real source of truth.

**Data flow:**

```txt
User fills Add Room form
  ↓
RoomsPage stores input in controlled form state
  ↓
Frontend validates basic input
  ↓
RoomsPage calls createRoom(roomPayload)
  ↓
roomService calls apiClient
  ↓
apiClient sends POST /rooms
  ↓
FastAPI validates and saves room
  ↓
RoomsPage refreshes rooms list
  ↓
Updated room appears in UI
```

**Important constraint discovered:**
Room numbers must be unique. During verification, creating a duplicate room number caused the backend/database to reject the request because `rooms.room_number` has a unique constraint.

This confirmed that:

- the frontend POST request was reaching the backend
- the backend was attempting to save the room
- SQLite was enforcing room-number uniqueness
- duplicate room handling should be improved in a future backend polish task

**What was intentionally not added:**

- edit room
- delete room
- inline room status update
- booking-based availability
- room images
- pagination
- sorting
- advanced filtering
- modal-based create form
- optimistic UI updates
- Electron-based room API logic
- localStorage room persistence

**Consequences:**
The Rooms module now has its first complete write workflow. The frontend can create real backend records while still preserving clean separation between React, service layer, API client, FastAPI, and SQLite.

This decision also establishes the pattern future create workflows should follow:

```txt
Page form → service function → apiClient → FastAPI endpoint → database → refetch UI
```

**Future considerations:**
Future milestones may add:

- room edit foundation using `PUT /rooms/{room_id}`
- room delete foundation using `DELETE /rooms/{room_id}`
- better backend duplicate-room handling with clear HTTP errors
- room status update rules
- booking-based room availability
- room filtering and search
- component extraction if `RoomsPage.jsx` becomes too larg

### Frontend AD 11 — Room Edit and Delete Through Service Layer

**Status:** Accepted
**Date Recorded:** 2026-07-08
**Milestone:** Milestone 11 — Rooms Module Edit and Delete Foundation
**Project:** HelloStay Frontend

#### Context

HelloStay is an offline desktop Hotel Management System built with FastAPI, React, and Electron.

By the end of Milestone 10, the Rooms module already supported reading rooms from the backend and creating new room records. Milestone 11 required the frontend to support updating and deleting existing room records.

The backend already exposes room update and delete endpoints:

```txt
PUT /rooms/{room_id}
DELETE /rooms/{room_id}
```

The backend also supports partial room updates through the `RoomUpdate` schema. FastAPI remains the source of truth for validation, database operations, and room records.

#### Decision

Room edit and delete functionality will be implemented in the React renderer process using the existing frontend service-layer pattern.

All room API calls must remain inside:

```txt
frontend/src/services/roomService.js
```

The Rooms page must call service functions instead of directly calling backend URLs.

The following service functions are accepted:

```txt
updateRoom(roomId, roomData)
deleteRoom(roomId)
```

`updateRoom` will call:

```txt
PUT /rooms/{room_id}
```

`deleteRoom` will call:

```txt
DELETE /rooms/{room_id}
```

The Rooms page will manage UI-specific state such as:

- selected room being edited
- form values
- create/edit mode
- update loading state
- update error state
- delete confirmation state
- delete loading state
- delete error state

After successful update or delete, the Rooms page will refetch the rooms list from the backend instead of performing optimistic local updates.

#### Why This Decision Was Made

This decision keeps the frontend architecture simple, readable, and beginner-friendly.

The service layer prevents API endpoint details from spreading across UI components. This makes the code easier to maintain because endpoint paths, HTTP methods, and request behavior stay centralized.

Reusing the room form for both create and edit avoids duplicate form code while still keeping the implementation small enough for the current stage of the project.

Refetching the rooms list after update or delete keeps the UI synchronized with the backend database. This is safer than manually updating local state because FastAPI remains the source of truth.

Optimistic updates were intentionally avoided because they add rollback complexity if the backend request fails.

Inline delete confirmation was chosen instead of a modal because it is simpler, easier to understand, and appropriate for this early foundation milestone.

#### Responsibility Separation

React renderer process is responsible for:

- Displaying room data
- Managing form state
- Switching between create and edit mode
- Showing update/delete loading states
- Showing update/delete error states
- Asking for delete confirmation
- Calling room service functions

Service layer is responsible for:

- Encapsulating room API functions
- Calling the existing API client
- Hiding endpoint details from page components

FastAPI backend is responsible for:

- Validating room data
- Updating room records
- Deleting room records
- Returning updated data or errors
- Protecting database integrity

Electron main process is responsible for:

- Desktop shell behavior
- App lifecycle
- Native window management

Electron main process must not contain room update or delete logic.

#### Affected Files

```txt
frontend/
  src/
    services/
      roomService.js

    pages/
      RoomsPage.jsx

    styles/
      global.css
```

#### Accepted Implementation Rules

The Rooms page may use state such as:

```txt
editingRoomId
formData
isSavingRoom
saveError
deleteConfirmId
deletingRoomId
deleteError
```

The edit form should be pre-filled from the selected room record.

The user must be able to cancel edit mode.

Delete must require confirmation before calling the backend.

The rooms list should refresh after successful update or delete.

Frontend validation may be used to improve user experience, but backend validation remains authoritative.

#### Rejected Alternatives

Directly calling `fetch` inside `RoomsPage.jsx` was rejected because it mixes API details with UI logic.

Moving room edit/delete logic into Electron was rejected because Electron should not contain hotel business logic or database workflow logic.

Using localStorage as the source of truth was rejected because room records must come from the backend database.

Optimistic update was rejected for this milestone because it introduces additional complexity too early.

A modal confirmation system was rejected for this milestone because inline confirmation is simpler and sufficient.

Creating advanced room-specific abstractions was rejected unless the page becomes too large to maintain.

#### Consequences

The Rooms module now follows a clearer CRUD architecture.

The code remains beginner-friendly while still following production-oriented separation of concerns.

The frontend remains aligned with the backend API contract.

Room data stays synchronized with the backend after updates and deletes.

The project is now better prepared for future Rooms module improvements such as filtering, searching, pagination, room status workflows, and booking/stay integration.

#### Future Considerations

Future milestones may revisit this decision when the Rooms module becomes more complex.

Possible future improvements include:

- Extracting a reusable `RoomForm` component
- Extracting a `RoomList` or `RoomTable` component
- Adding search and filters
- Adding pagination
- Adding room status workflows
- Adding booking-based availability
- Adding modal confirmation for destructive actions
- Adding optimistic updates if the UX requires it
- Adding stronger validation helpers
- Adding automated tests for room service functions and Rooms page behavior

#### Summary

Frontend AD 11 establishes that room update and delete operations must go through the frontend service layer, not directly through page components or Electron.

React manages the user interface and interaction state.

The service layer manages API communication.

FastAPI remains the source of truth for room data and validation.

This decision completes the basic CRUD foundation for the Rooms module while preserving HelloStay’s clean frontend architecture.

### Frontend AD 12 — Refine Rooms Module Through Small Component Extraction

**Status:** Accepted
**Date Recorded:** 2026-07-08
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 12 — Rooms Module UX Refinement and Code Cleanup

After completing room listing, creation, editing, and deletion in Milestones 9, 10, and 11, the Rooms page had enough behavior to justify a small refactor.

The decision was made to refine the Rooms module through limited component extraction and visual cleanup while preserving all existing behavior.

**Decision:**

Keep `RoomsPage.jsx` as the page-level coordinator for the Rooms module, but extract focused room-specific UI into smaller components where it improves readability.

The accepted structure is:

- `RoomsPage.jsx` for page state, API coordination, loading state, error state, success messages, create/edit mode, and refresh behavior.
- `RoomForm.jsx` for the create/edit room form UI.
- `RoomTable.jsx` for displaying the room list and room-level actions.
- `roomService.js` for all room API calls.
- `global.css` for visual layout and styling improvements.

**Why this decision was made:**

The Rooms module had become more complex after adding read, create, update, and delete behavior. Keeping everything inside one page file would still work, but the file would become harder to read and maintain as the application grows.

Extracting `RoomForm.jsx` and `RoomTable.jsx` improves readability because the form and list are separate UI concerns. This allows `RoomsPage.jsx` to focus on feature behavior instead of being overloaded with all JSX details.

This refactor is intentionally small. It improves code clarity without introducing unnecessary architecture such as custom hooks, reducers, global state, or external state libraries.

**Architecture rules confirmed:**

- FastAPI remains the source of truth for room data and validation.
- React does not store room data as the permanent source of truth.
- `localStorage` is not used as the source of truth for rooms.
- All room API calls remain inside `roomService.js`.
- `RoomsPage.jsx` coordinates API calls through `roomService.js`.
- `RoomForm.jsx` and `RoomTable.jsx` do not call the backend directly.
- Electron main process does not contain room UI logic or room API logic.
- React renderer owns UI, form state, interaction, loading states, and error display.
- Backend business logic is not moved into React or Electron.

**Component responsibility decision:**

`RoomsPage.jsx` owns state because create/edit/delete behavior affects the whole page.

`RoomForm.jsx` receives form data, validation errors, mode, loading state, and handlers through props. It does not own the main room form state.

`RoomTable.jsx` receives rooms and action handlers through props. It does not perform API requests directly.

This keeps data flow simple:

`RoomsPage.jsx → RoomForm.jsx`
`RoomsPage.jsx → RoomTable.jsx`
`RoomsPage.jsx → roomService.js → FastAPI`

**Design decision:**

The Rooms page should follow the HelloStay V1 frontend design direction: clean, modern, desktop-first, professional, and easy for hotel staff to scan.

The UI should use:

- clear page headings,
- card-based surfaces,
- consistent spacing,
- readable typography,
- clean form layout,
- desktop-friendly room table,
- visible status badges,
- clear edit and delete actions,
- understandable loading, empty, error, and success states.

The UI should not become flashy or overly complex. Clarity is more important than visual decoration.

**Rejected alternatives:**

A full rewrite of the Rooms module was rejected because the existing behavior was already working.

A large abstraction using custom hooks was rejected because it would hide important learning concepts too early.

Global state for rooms was rejected because only the Rooms page currently needs this data.

Reducers were rejected because the current state transitions are still understandable with `useState`.

External state libraries were rejected because they are unnecessary for this stage of the project.

A modal-based create/edit flow was rejected for now because it would add extra UI complexity before the basic page flow is fully mastered.

**Consequences:**

The Rooms module is now easier to understand and maintain.

The page has a cleaner separation between feature behavior and UI rendering.

The create/edit/delete flow remains connected to the backend through the existing service layer.

The project remains beginner-friendly while still moving toward production-quality structure.

Future milestones can build on this pattern when implementing Guests, Bookings, Stays, Finance, History, and Settings.

**Final decision:**

Use small, practical component extraction for the Rooms module and keep the architecture simple. Preserve backend integration, avoid premature abstraction, and improve the user experience without changing the business behavior.

### Frontend AD 13: Guests Module Read-Only Service and Page Pattern

**Status:** Accepted
**Date Recorded:** 2026-07-08
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 13 — Guests Module Read-Only Foundation

The HelloStay frontend will implement the Guests module using the same clean service/page separation pattern already proven in the Rooms module. Guest data must be read from the FastAPI backend through a dedicated frontend service file instead of being fetched directly inside the page component.

**Decision:**

Create a dedicated `guestService.js` file inside the frontend services folder and use it as the only place for guest-related API calls.

For Milestone 13, the service exposes only one function:

`getGuests()`

This function calls:

`GET /guests`

through the existing `apiClient.js`.

The `GuestsPage.jsx` component consumes `guestService.getGuests()` and is responsible only for UI behavior, including loading, error, empty, and success states.

**Why this decision was made:**

The Guests module is the second major backend-connected dashboard module after Rooms. This makes it an important opportunity to confirm that the frontend architecture is reusable and not hardcoded for only one feature.

Keeping guest API calls inside `guestService.js` improves separation of concerns. The page component does not need to know how the HTTP request is built, how the base URL is handled, or how the API client processes the response. The page only needs to request guest data and render the correct UI state.

This pattern also makes the module easier to grow in future milestones. Later guest features such as create, update, delete, search, filters, and guest stay history can be added to the guest service and Guests page in a controlled way without mixing too many responsibilities too early.

**Architecture rules accepted in this decision:**

- Guest data must come from FastAPI, not from hardcoded frontend data.
- `localStorage` must not be used as the source of truth for guests.
- `GuestsPage.jsx` should not directly call `fetch`.
- Guest API logic belongs in `guestService.js`.
- Common HTTP behavior remains inside `apiClient.js`.
- FastAPI remains the source of truth for validation, database operations, and API contracts.
- React is responsible for UI state and rendering.
- Electron main process must not contain guest API logic.
- Guest create, edit, delete, stay history, and booking integration must be handled in later milestones.

**Affected files:**

- `frontend/src/services/guestService.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/GuestsPage.jsx`
- `frontend/src/styles/global.css` if guest-specific styling was added globally

**Result:**

The Guests page now follows a production-oriented frontend pattern:

`GuestsPage.jsx → guestService.js → apiClient.js → FastAPI GET /guests`

This decision keeps the Guests module simple, testable, beginner-friendly, and ready for future expansion.

---

### Frontend AD 14: Guest Creation Through Service Layer and Backend Source of Truth

**Status:** Accepted
**Date Recorded:** 2026-07-08
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 14 — Guests Module Create Foundation

The Guests module will create guest records through the FastAPI backend using a dedicated guest service function instead of handling API calls directly inside the page component or storing guest records locally in the frontend.

**Decision:**

Add guest creation by extending the existing Guests module with a `createGuest(guestData)` function inside `guestService.js`. The function sends a `POST /guests` request through the shared `apiClient.js`.

The `GuestsPage.jsx` component owns only the UI state required for the create flow, including form values, frontend validation messages, create loading state, and create error state. After a guest is created successfully, the frontend clears the form and refetches the guest list from the backend.

**Why this decision was made:**

FastAPI remains the source of truth for guest records, backend validation, duplicate constraints, database writes, and API contracts. React should not directly perform database-like operations or treat local state as the permanent source of truth for guests.

Using `guestService.js` keeps API communication organized and consistent with earlier milestones. This follows the same service-layer pattern already used by the Rooms module and the read-only Guests module.

Refetching the guest list after successful creation was chosen instead of optimistic updates because this milestone prioritizes correctness, simplicity, and beginner-friendly learning. Refetching ensures the UI reflects the actual backend/database state after creation.

**Architecture rules confirmed:**

- React renderer process handles the guest form, UI state, validation messages, and user interactions.
- `guestService.js` handles guest API functions.
- `apiClient.js` handles shared request behavior.
- FastAPI handles validation, persistence, duplicate constraints, and returned guest records.
- Electron main process does not contain guest creation logic.
- Preload/IPC is not used for normal guest CRUD API calls in this milestone.
- Local storage is not used as the source of truth for guest records.

**Implementation notes:**

The guest creation form uses controlled components. Each input value is stored in React state and updated through an `onChange` handler. The input `name` attributes match the backend field names so the frontend form data maps directly to the backend guest creation schema.

Basic frontend validation was added for all required fields:

- Guest name is required
- Guest phone number is required
- Guest address is required
- ID proof type is required
- ID proof number is required

Frontend validation improves user experience by catching missing fields before sending the request. Backend validation and database constraints still remain the final authority.

The initial guest loading logic was adjusted to avoid the React Hooks `set-state-in-effect` lint issue. Data fetching was separated from immediate state updates so that `useEffect` starts the asynchronous fetch and state updates occur after the request resolves.

**Affected files:**

- `frontend/src/services/guestService.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/GuestsPage.jsx`

**Rejected alternatives:**

Directly calling `fetch()` inside `GuestsPage.jsx` was rejected because it would mix page UI logic with API implementation details.

Using optimistic updates was rejected for this milestone because it adds complexity and can make the frontend temporarily show data that may not match the backend.

Creating a separate `GuestForm.jsx` component was deferred because the current milestone benefits from keeping the create flow visible and beginner-friendly inside `GuestsPage.jsx`.

Using a modal form was rejected because it would add extra UI state, accessibility concerns, and unnecessary complexity before the basic create flow is fully understood.

**Result:**

Guest creation now follows the established HelloStay frontend architecture: React manages the UI, the service layer manages API calls, and FastAPI remains the source of truth for guest data.

---

### Frontend AD 15: Guest Updates and Deletions Use Service-Layer Mutations with Server Refetching

**Status:** Accepted
**Date Recorded:** 2026-07-15
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 15 — Guests Module Edit and Delete Foundation

The HelloStay Guests module supports editing and deleting guest records through the existing frontend service layer while keeping FastAPI as the source of truth.

**Decision:**

Guest update and delete operations must be performed through `guestService.js` using the existing shared `apiClient.js`.

The Guests page must not call backend endpoints directly. It should express user actions through service functions such as:

- `updateGuest(guestId, guestData)`
- `deleteGuest(guestId)`

Guest updates use:

- `PUT /guests/{guest_id}`

Guest deletions use:

- `DELETE /guests/{guest_id}`

After a successful update or deletion, the frontend refetches the guest list from the backend instead of relying on optimistic updates or treating local React state as the permanent source of truth.

Editing uses a separate editable copy of the selected guest. The original selected guest record and the controlled edit-form state remain separate so the frontend can pre-fill fields, detect changed values, cancel editing safely, and avoid directly mutating list data.

Guest deletion requires an explicit inline confirmation before the destructive request is sent.

**Why this decision was made:**

FastAPI remains responsible for validation, database operations, uniqueness constraints, and guest persistence. Keeping all guest requests inside `guestService.js` preserves the established frontend architecture and prevents endpoint details from spreading across React components.

Refetching after update and delete ensures that the UI reflects the backend’s confirmed state. It is simpler and safer than optimistic updates during the current stage of the project because it avoids rollback logic and local-state synchronization problems.

Separate edit state makes the editing workflow easier to understand and maintain. It prevents the displayed guest list from being mutated while the user is typing and allows edit mode to be cancelled without affecting backend or list data.

Inline delete confirmation was chosen instead of a modal because it is beginner-friendly, visually connected to the selected guest, and does not require premature modal infrastructure, focus management, keyboard handling, or overlay behavior.

**Architecture boundaries:**

- React renderer process manages guest forms, selected guest state, loading states, validation messages, confirmation UI, and user interaction.
- `guestService.js` owns guest-related API operations and endpoint paths.
- `apiClient.js` owns shared request configuration, response parsing, authentication headers, and normalized request errors.
- FastAPI remains responsible for guest validation, updates, deletions, database persistence, and duplicate-field enforcement.
- Electron main process and preload scripts do not contain guest CRUD logic.
- Local storage is not used as the source of truth for guest records.

**Update strategy:**

The edit form is pre-filled from the selected guest record.

Before submission:

- Form values are trimmed.
- Required-field validation is performed.
- Edited values are compared with the original guest.
- Only changed fields are included in the update payload.
- A request is not sent when no values have changed.

Frontend validation improves usability, but backend validation remains authoritative.

**Delete strategy:**

The first Delete action opens an inline confirmation state for the selected guest.

The actual DELETE request is sent only after the user confirms the destructive action.

During deletion:

- The selected guest’s delete action shows a loading state.
- Repeated delete submissions are disabled.
- The confirmation remains visible if deletion fails.
- Backend error messages are displayed when available.
- The guest list is refetched after successful deletion.

**Loading and error-state decision:**

Create, update, and delete operations use separate loading and error states.

This prevents one operation from incorrectly controlling unrelated UI and makes it clear which action is currently running or has failed.

Examples include:

- `isCreating`
- `isUpdating`
- `deletingGuestId`
- `createError`
- `updateError`
- `deleteError`

A guest ID is stored for delete loading instead of using only a general Boolean so the UI can identify the exact guest being deleted.

**Affected files:**

- `frontend/src/services/guestService.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/GuestsPage.jsx`
- Guest-related styles in the existing frontend stylesheet

**Consequences:**

**Positive consequences:**

- Guest API logic remains centralized.
- The backend continues to be the source of truth.
- Editing is predictable and cancelable.
- Destructive deletion requires confirmation.
- Loading and error states are operation-specific.
- The implementation remains small and understandable.
- The approach follows the established Rooms module architecture without blindly copying its code.
- The design can later support reusable guest components.

**Trade-offs:**

- Refetching performs an additional GET request after each mutation.
- The edit form currently adds more state and handlers to `GuestsPage.jsx`.
- Inline confirmation is simpler than a modal but may require later visual refinement.
- Duplicate database errors depend on the quality of backend error responses.
- Optimistic UI updates are intentionally postponed.

**Rejected alternatives:**

- Calling FastAPI directly from `GuestsPage.jsx`.
- Moving guest update or delete logic into Electron.
- Treating React state or local storage as permanent guest storage.
- Deleting a guest immediately after the first click.
- Introducing a modal system only for this milestone.
- Optimistically updating the list before the backend confirms success.
- Building guest stays, bookings, history, document upload, or OCR during this milestone.

**Future implications:**

A future Guests UX refinement milestone may extract reusable components such as:

- `GuestForm.jsx`
- `GuestCard.jsx`
- `GuestList.jsx`

A later backend-hardening milestone may provide consistent conflict responses for duplicate phone numbers and ID proof numbers.

Guest stay history, booking integration, activity timelines, document handling, filtering, sorting, and pagination should remain separate future milestones.

### Frontend AD 16 — Separate Blocking Load Errors from Non-Blocking Refresh Errors

**Status:** Accepted

**Context**

The Guests module loads its initial guest collection using `GET /guests` and refreshes that collection after successful create, update, and delete operations.

Previously, the Guests page used one general error state for both:

- failure of the initial guest request
- failure of a later guest-list refresh

The guest list was rendered only when that general error state was empty. As a result, a failed refresh after a successful guest mutation could hide guest data that had already been loaded successfully.

This created an inaccurate and unnecessarily disruptive user experience. A failed refresh does not mean that the previously loaded guest data has become unusable. It only means that the frontend could not retrieve the newest collection from the backend.

**Decision**

The Guests module will maintain separate collection-level error states:

- `loadError` represents failure of the initial guest-list request.
- `refreshError` represents failure of a later refresh after a successful mutation.

`loadError` is treated as a blocking error because the frontend has not received a reliable guest collection.

`refreshError` is treated as a non-blocking warning because the frontend may still display the previously loaded guest collection.

The guest list and empty state will depend on the absence of `loadError`. They will not depend on the absence of `refreshError`.

Create, update, and delete errors will continue to use their own operation-specific error states.

**Resulting Behavior**

When the initial `GET /guests` request fails:

- the loading state ends
- the backend connection error is displayed
- the empty state is not displayed
- the guest collection is not displayed because no reliable collection was loaded

When a refresh after a successful mutation fails:

- the successful mutation is not incorrectly reported as failed
- a refresh warning is displayed
- the existing guest collection remains visible
- the interface communicates that the visible data may not contain the newest backend changes

When a later refresh succeeds:

- the guest collection is replaced with the latest backend response
- `loadError` is cleared
- `refreshError` is cleared

**Rationale**

This approach improves resilience and makes the interface accurately represent the operation that failed.

It follows the principle that previously loaded, usable data should remain visible during a recoverable network failure.

It also improves code readability because each error state now has one clear responsibility.

**Alternatives Considered**

**One shared error state**

This approach was rejected because it combined unrelated failures and caused non-blocking refresh failures to hide existing data.

**Clear the guest collection when a refresh fails**

This approach was rejected because the previous collection may still be useful. Clearing it would unnecessarily reduce usability.

**Store every error inside one configuration object**

This approach was not selected because separate state variables are currently more explicit and beginner-friendly at the Guests module’s present complexity.

**Consequences**

Positive consequences:

- Existing guest data remains visible during refresh failures.
- Error messages accurately distinguish failed mutations from failed refreshes.
- Collection rendering conditions are easier to understand.
- Future retry behavior can be added without redesigning the error model.
- Create, update, delete, load, and refresh failures remain isolated.

Trade-offs:

- The component contains one additional state variable.
- The interface may temporarily display stale guest data after a failed refresh.
- The warning must clearly communicate that the newest collection could not be retrieved.

**Responsibility Boundaries**

React renderer:

- owns `loadError` and `refreshError`
- decides which feedback state is rendered
- preserves the previously loaded guest collection

Guest service and API client:

- perform guest HTTP requests
- throw meaningful request and network errors

FastAPI:

- remains the source of truth for guest data
- performs validation and database operations

Electron main process:

- contains no guest API or guest UI logic

**Verification**

The decision was verified by:

- loading guests successfully with FastAPI running
- stopping FastAPI and confirming that the initial connection failure appears as a blocking load error
- confirming that the empty state is not shown when the backend is unavailable
- temporarily simulating a failure inside the post-mutation refresh function
- successfully updating a guest before the simulated refresh failure
- confirming that the refresh warning appears
- confirming that existing guest cards remain visible
- removing the temporary failure simulation after testing

### Frontend AD 17 — Keep Stay Retrieval Behind a Dedicated Service and Model the Stays Page as a Read-Only Transactional View

#### Status

Accepted

#### Context

HelloStay required its first frontend view of operational Stay records.

The backend already exposed Stay data through:

`GET /stay`

Each Stay response contains:

- `stay_id`
- `room_id`
- `price_per_night`
- `check_in_datetime`
- `check_out_datetime`
- `stay_status`

Stay records differ from Room and Guest records.

Rooms and Guests primarily represent master or identity data. A Stay represents an operational transaction that records room occupancy over time.

The backend also stores guest relationships separately through the GuestStay junction model and `/guest-stays` API. Guest relationships are therefore not part of the basic Stay response.

The frontend needed a focused, reliable read-only foundation before introducing creation, lifecycle transitions, guest assignment, billing, or other transactional complexity.

#### Decision

HelloStay will use a dedicated `stayService.js` file as the frontend HTTP boundary for Stay-related API operations.

For the read-only foundation:

- `StaysPage.jsx` owns page-level orchestration.
- `stayService.js` owns the Stay HTTP request function.
- `apiClient.js` continues to own shared URL construction, request configuration, JSON parsing, network failures, and backend-error handling.
- `getStays()` calls `GET /stay`.
- `StaysPage.jsx` must not call `fetch()` directly.
- Electron main and preload processes are not involved in normal Stay API communication.
- Stay records remain backend-driven.
- The page stores raw Stay records rather than formatted copies.
- Display formatting is derived during rendering through small pure helper functions.
- Backend response values are treated as untrusted input and validated before rendering.
- The page explicitly models loading, error, empty, and success states.
- The backend-owned `stay_status` value remains the displayed source of truth.
- `check_out_datetime: null` is treated as a valid active-Stay condition.
- `price_per_night` is treated as a historical snapshot and displayed from the Stay record itself.
- The initial implementation displays `room_id` safely rather than introducing a second Room request before the core Stay list works.
- Guest relationships remain deferred to a dedicated GuestStay integration milestone.

#### Selected Architecture

```text
React renderer
    │
    │ Calls getStays()
    ▼
stayService.js
    │
    │ Calls apiRequest("/stay")
    ▼
apiClient.js
    │
    │ Sends HTTP GET
    ▼
FastAPI
    │
    ▼
Stay records from backend persistence
```

#### Responsibility Boundaries

##### FastAPI

FastAPI remains responsible for:

- Stay validation
- Stay persistence
- Stay business rules
- Stay status values
- Check-in and checkout timestamps
- Historical nightly-price snapshots
- Room references
- API response contracts

##### `apiClient.js`

The shared API client remains responsible for:

- API base URL handling
- URL construction
- Request headers
- JSON request serialization
- Response parsing
- HTTP error conversion
- Network error conversion
- Shared API behavior

##### `stayService.js`

The Stay service is responsible for:

- Exposing frontend functions related to the Stay API
- Calling the correct singular backend endpoint
- Preserving a clear domain-specific service boundary

For this milestone, it contains only:

```js
getStays();
```

##### `StaysPage.jsx`

The Stays page is responsible for:

- Starting the initial request
- Managing page-level loading state
- Managing the initial error message
- Storing raw Stay records
- Validating that the response is an array
- Preventing obsolete asynchronous results from updating state
- Selecting loading, error, empty, or success UI
- Rendering the read-only Stay table
- Deriving human-readable display values
- Applying presentation classes to known status values

##### Electron

Electron remains responsible for:

- Desktop application lifecycle
- Native window management
- Desktop startup behavior
- Future operating-system integrations

Electron will not fetch Stay records.

##### Preload and IPC

Preload and IPC are not required for standard renderer-to-FastAPI HTTP communication.

They will only be introduced where secure desktop capabilities require communication between the renderer and Electron main process.

#### Reasons

##### Preserve the service boundary

Keeping Stay requests in `stayService.js` prevents page components from becoming tightly coupled to HTTP implementation details.

It also keeps the frontend consistent with the existing Room and Guest service patterns.

##### Keep FastAPI as the source of truth

React displays Stay records but does not own Stay business rules, status transitions, billing logic, or persistence.

##### Establish read-only behavior first

Stay workflows are more transactional than Room and Guest CRUD.

Read-only integration allows the team to verify:

- API shape
- Date handling
- Null checkout behavior
- Status values
- Historical rate display
- Table usability
- Error handling

before introducing mutations or lifecycle actions.

##### Preserve raw backend data

Formatted dates and prices are presentation values.

They should not be stored as duplicate state because they can be derived from the raw response whenever React renders.

##### Treat nullable checkout as meaningful

An active Stay may not yet have a checkout timestamp.

The frontend therefore renders a clear fallback instead of treating the value as invalid.

##### Avoid incorrect Guest assumptions

A Stay does not directly provide Guest data.

The frontend must not guess guest relationships from Room IDs or other unrelated values.

##### Avoid premature Room lookup complexity

The core contract already provides `room_id`.

Displaying a safe room reference allows the primary Stay integration to be verified before adding an optional secondary Room request.

##### Avoid unnecessary global state

The read-only Stay request is local to one page.

Context, Redux, Zustand, `useReducer`, or a custom fetching abstraction would add complexity without solving a current problem.

#### Consequences

##### Positive Consequences

- Stay API communication has a clear location.
- `StaysPage.jsx` remains independent of low-level `fetch()` details.
- Shared network and backend errors remain consistent.
- The initial implementation is easy to inspect and debug.
- Loading, error, empty, and success behavior is explicit.
- API response validation prevents `.map()` failures on invalid data.
- Raw backend values remain unchanged.
- Status meaning remains backend-owned.
- Null checkout timestamps are handled safely.
- Historical price values are preserved.
- The implementation remains compatible with the Electron security model.
- Future Stay mutations can be added to the same service boundary.
- GuestStay integration can be introduced separately without rewriting the basic Stay list.

##### Trade-offs

- The first table displays Room IDs rather than room numbers.
- Guest names are not visible.
- The page does not yet support lifecycle actions.
- Some table and formatting logic remains inside `StaysPage.jsx`.
- The effect cleanup guard ignores obsolete results but does not cancel the underlying HTTP request.
- React Strict Mode may still cause duplicate development requests.

These trade-offs are acceptable for a focused read-only foundation.

#### Alternatives Considered

##### Call `fetch()` directly in `StaysPage.jsx`

Rejected because it would bypass the shared API client and duplicate URL, parsing, and error-handling logic.

##### Fetch Stays through Electron IPC

Rejected because normal FastAPI HTTP communication belongs in the React renderer. Electron IPC is for approved desktop capabilities, not ordinary backend requests.

##### Introduce a Stays Context

Rejected because the Stay list is currently used by one page and does not require application-wide shared state.

##### Add Redux, Zustand, or another state library

Rejected because three local state values are sufficient for the current request.

##### Create a generic CRUD hook

Rejected because this milestone is read-only and a generic CRUD abstraction would hide important data-flow concepts while introducing unnecessary complexity.

##### Load Rooms and Guests immediately

Rejected because it would add multiple APIs, more error states, relationship mapping, and unnecessary dependencies before the basic Stay contract was verified.

##### Mutate Stay objects with formatted fields

Rejected because raw API records and display formatting should remain separate.

##### Reuse Room-status CSS semantics

Rejected because Room status and Stay status represent different domain concepts, even when they are operationally related.

##### Build a future Bookings module

Rejected because the current backend implements Stay records rather than a complete future-reservation system.

#### Implementation Rules Established

- Use the frontend term **Stays**.
- Use `/dashboard/stays` for protected navigation.
- Use `/stay` for backend API communication.
- Keep Stay HTTP functions in `stayService.js`.
- Use `apiClient.js` for shared request handling.
- Keep request orchestration in `StaysPage.jsx`.
- Verify that the response is an array.
- Keep `stays` state as an array.
- Use `stay_id` as the React key.
- Treat `check_out_datetime` as nullable.
- Display backend `stay_status` values without inventing new statuses.
- Keep formatted dates and prices out of React state.
- Do not hardcode a currency symbol until currency configuration exists.
- Do not infer Guest relationships.
- Do not infer Room status from Stay status.
- Do not calculate duration, billing, or total charges in the read-only foundation.
- Do not add Stay mutations until a later milestone.
- Do not involve Electron main or preload in ordinary Stay HTTP requests.

#### Future Reconsideration Triggers

This decision may be revisited when:

- Stay creation is implemented.
- Check-in and checkout lifecycle actions are introduced.
- GuestStay relationships are integrated.
- Room numbers are displayed through a Room lookup.
- Multiple Stay screens require shared state.
- Search, filtering, sorting, or pagination is added.
- Stay table markup becomes large enough to justify extraction.
- Request cancellation becomes necessary.
- Currency configuration is introduced.
- Billing and payment modules consume Stay data.

#### Final Decision

HelloStay will treat the Stays module as a backend-driven transactional feature.

The initial frontend implementation will remain read-only, use a dedicated Stay service, preserve raw backend data, derive display formatting during rendering, and keep Guest, Room-lookup, lifecycle, and billing concerns outside the first Stay milestone.

---

### Frontend AD 18 — Stays Module Create Workflow

#### Decision

The Stays module will implement stay creation using a controlled React form and the existing service-layer architecture.

React will manage form state, user interaction, client-side validation, submission state, and UI feedback.

The service layer will manage API communication.

FastAPI will remain responsible for authoritative validation, business rules, and persistence.

#### Context

The Stays module previously provided a read-only list of stay records.

Milestone 18 introduces the first create workflow for the module.

The implementation therefore needs to establish a clear boundary between:

- Form state.
- UI interaction.
- Client-side validation.
- API communication.
- Backend validation.
- Persistence.
- Success and error feedback.

The existing HelloStay architecture should be extended rather than replaced.

#### Architectural Boundary

The selected responsibility flow is:

```text
React Renderer
     ↓
StaysPage.jsx
     ↓
stayService.js
     ↓
apiClient.js
     ↓
FastAPI
     ↓
Database
```

`StaysPage.jsx` is responsible for the user-facing workflow.

`stayService.js` is responsible for the stay API operation.

`apiClient.js` remains responsible for the shared HTTP request mechanism.

FastAPI remains responsible for business logic and persistence.

#### Controlled Form Decision

The Create Stay form uses controlled React inputs.

The current form values are stored in React state:

```text
room_id
price_per_night
check_in_datetime
stay_status
```

Each input receives its value from React state and updates that state through the form change handler.

This provides a predictable flow between user input, validation, payload creation, and submission.

#### Client-Side Validation Decision

Basic validation is performed in the React frontend before submitting the request.

The frontend validates required fields and basic input constraints to provide immediate feedback to the user.

Client-side validation is not considered authoritative.

The backend remains responsible for final validation because frontend validation can be bypassed and backend rules may be more comprehensive.

#### Service Layer Decision

The Stays page does not directly implement HTTP communication.

Stay creation is performed through:

```text
createStay(stayData)
```

in `stayService.js`.

The service delegates the request to `apiClient.js`.

This keeps API communication separate from the presentation and interaction logic of the React page.

#### Payload Decision

Browser form values are initially represented as strings.

Before sending the request, fields that require numeric values are converted to numbers.

The frontend constructs the API payload before calling the service function.

The payload follows the existing backend contract:

```text
{
  room_id,
  price_per_night,
  check_in_datetime,
  stay_status
}
```

#### Submission State Decision

The create workflow maintains a dedicated `isSubmitting` state.

While the request is active:

- The submit button is disabled.
- The user receives feedback that creation is in progress.
- Accidental duplicate submissions are prevented.

The submission state is independent from the initial stay-list loading state.

#### Post-Creation Synchronization Decision

After a successful create request, the frontend refreshes the stay list by calling `getStays()` again.

The chosen flow is:

```text
POST /stay
    ↓
Successful creation
    ↓
GET /stay
    ↓
Update stays state
```

The frontend therefore treats the backend as the source of truth instead of manually modifying the existing stay list.

#### Form Reset Decision

After successful creation, the form is reset to its initial state.

Resetting also clears the field-level validation errors.

This provides a clean form for the next stay creation.

#### Error Handling Decision

Different error types remain separate:

- Initial stay loading errors are handled by the stay-list loading state.
- Room loading errors are handled by the room-selection workflow.
- Validation errors are associated with individual fields.
- Stay creation errors are displayed at the form level.

This separation improves both maintainability and user understanding.

#### UX Decision

The Create Stay workflow must follow the existing HelloStay interface.

The implementation should reuse existing UI patterns and styling rather than introducing a separate design system.

The form therefore follows the application's existing:

- Card structure.
- Form-field layout.
- Error presentation.
- Button behavior.
- Typography.
- Spacing.
- Feedback patterns.

#### Scope Boundary

This Architecture Decision does not introduce:

- Stay edit functionality.
- Stay delete functionality.
- Check-out functionality.
- Stay detail workflows.
- Global state management.
- A form-management library.
- Additional abstraction layers without a demonstrated need.

These concerns will be considered only in the milestones where they are explicitly required.

#### Consequences

##### Positive Consequences

- Maintains the existing HelloStay architecture.
- Keeps React responsibilities clear.
- Keeps API communication inside the service layer.
- Keeps backend business rules inside FastAPI.
- Provides immediate client-side validation feedback.
- Prevents duplicate submissions.
- Keeps the stay list synchronized with backend data.
- Keeps the implementation understandable for continued frontend learning.

##### Trade-offs

- `StaysPage.jsx` contains several pieces of form-related state and logic.
- A second API request is made after successful creation to refresh the stay list.
- Client-side validation exists alongside backend validation.

These trade-offs are acceptable for the current size and complexity of the Stays module.

Further abstraction should only be introduced when the module's complexity provides a clear reason for it.

#### Engineering Principle

The Stays module follows this principle:

> React manages user interaction and presentation, the service layer manages API communication, and FastAPI remains the source of truth for business logic, validation, and persistence.

This decision keeps the Create Stay workflow aligned with the overall HelloStay frontend architecture.

---

### Frontend AD 19 — Stays Module Mutation State and CRUD Interaction

#### Decision

The Stays module will implement create, update, and delete operations through dedicated UI state, event handlers, validation, and service-layer functions while keeping the FastAPI backend as the source of truth for business rules and data persistence.

Each mutation workflow will have its own loading, error, and interaction state where necessary.

#### Context

The Stays module initially provided read-only functionality and was subsequently extended with stay creation.

Milestone 19 introduced edit and delete functionality.

As mutation functionality increases, the page needs to distinguish between different operations rather than treating all requests as one generic loading state.

For example:

- Creating a stay should not be confused with updating a stay.
- Updating a stay should not use the delete operation's loading state.
- A delete confirmation should not immediately perform the API request.
- An API failure should be displayed in the appropriate part of the UI.

#### Decision Details

The Stays page will use operation-specific state.

Examples include:

```text
isSubmitting
isUpdating
isDeleting
```

These states represent different asynchronous operations.

The selected records are also maintained independently:

```text
editingStay
deletingStay
```

This allows the UI to know which stay is currently being edited or deleted.

#### Edit State Design

Editing a stay requires separate state from the original stay collection.

The selected stay is stored separately from the edit form:

```text
editingStay
editStayForm
editFormErrors
editFormError
isUpdating
```

This separation allows the user to modify form values without immediately changing the stay displayed in the main collection.

The original stay object therefore remains unchanged until the backend confirms the update.

#### Delete State Design

Deletion follows a confirmation-first approach.

The frontend first records the selected stay:

```text
deletingStay
```

The user is then shown a confirmation interface.

Only after explicit confirmation should the frontend perform the delete request.

The deletion operation also maintains:

```text
isDeleting
deleteError
```

This prevents accidental deletion and provides appropriate feedback while the request is running.

#### Service Layer Responsibility

The Stays page does not perform HTTP requests directly.

API communication is delegated to `stayService.js`.

The service layer exposes:

```text
getStays()
createStay(stayData)
updateStay(stayId, stayData)
deleteStay(stayId)
```

These functions use the shared `apiClient.js`.

The resulting responsibility chain is:

```text
StaysPage
    ↓
stayService
    ↓
apiClient
    ↓
FastAPI
```

#### Backend as Source of Truth

The frontend performs basic validation for user experience, but backend validation remains authoritative.

The frontend must not duplicate hotel business rules unnecessarily.

For example, the frontend may verify that a required field has been entered, while the backend remains responsible for determining whether the requested stay modification is actually valid according to hotel business rules.

#### Update Contract

The frontend follows the existing backend `StayUpdate` contract.

The backend defines the update fields as optional:

```text
room_id
price_per_night
check_in_datetime
check_out_datetime
stay_status
```

The current frontend edit workflow uses the fields exposed by the milestone's edit UI:

```text
room_id
price_per_night
check_in_datetime
```

The frontend should not introduce unsupported assumptions about backend update behavior.

#### Refresh After Mutation

After a successful create, update, or delete operation, the Stays page refreshes the stay collection from the backend.

The preferred flow is:

```text
Mutation
   ↓
Backend confirms success
   ↓
GET /stay
   ↓
Update React state
   ↓
Render current data
```

This avoids treating the frontend's local representation as the authoritative version of the database.

#### Error Handling Decision

Mutation errors should remain visible to the user.

The frontend should:

1. Start the appropriate loading state.
2. Perform the service request.
3. Handle successful completion.
4. Refresh the relevant data.
5. Display success feedback when appropriate.
6. Catch request failures.
7. Display a useful error message.
8. Reset the operation's loading state.

This creates predictable asynchronous behavior.

#### Duplicate Submission Prevention

Mutation controls should be disabled while their corresponding request is running.

For example:

```text
isSubmitting → Create button
isUpdating   → Edit controls
isDeleting   → Delete confirmation controls
```

This reduces accidental duplicate API requests caused by repeated clicks.

#### UI Responsibility

The React page is responsible for:

- Rendering forms.
- Rendering confirmation UI.
- Managing component state.
- Handling user events.
- Performing client-side validation.
- Showing loading feedback.
- Showing success feedback.
- Showing request errors.

It is not responsible for:

- Database operations.
- Hotel business rules.
- Authentication decisions.
- Authorization decisions.
- Backend data validation.
- Persistence.

#### Consequences

##### Benefits

- Clear separation of responsibilities.
- Easier debugging.
- Easier testing of individual workflows.
- Better user feedback.
- Reduced accidental duplicate requests.
- Cleaner integration with the existing service layer.
- Backend remains the single source of truth.
- Future mutation workflows can follow the same pattern.

##### Trade-offs

The Stays page now contains more state and event handlers.

This is acceptable at the current module size, but continued growth could eventually justify extracting smaller components or dedicated hooks.

Such refactoring should be performed when complexity actually requires it rather than introducing unnecessary abstraction prematurely.

#### Alternatives Considered

##### Single Generic Loading State

A single `isLoading` state could represent every operation.

**Rejected** because loading the page, creating a stay, updating a stay, and deleting a stay are different operations and should provide independent UI feedback.

##### Updating Local State Directly After Mutation

The frontend could manually modify the existing `stays` array after a successful mutation.

**Not selected as the primary approach** because refreshing from the backend keeps the frontend synchronized with the backend's authoritative representation.

##### Direct API Calls From the Component

The component could call `fetch()` directly.

**Rejected** because HelloStay already has a service layer and shared API client. Keeping API communication in `stayService.js` maintains consistency across modules.

##### Moving Business Logic Into React

Hotel-specific update or deletion rules could be implemented in the frontend.

**Rejected** because FastAPI is the project's source of truth for business logic, validation, authorization, and persistence.

#### Industry Practice

This decision follows several production-oriented principles:

- Keep UI concerns separate from API communication.
- Keep backend business rules authoritative.
- Represent asynchronous operations explicitly.
- Prevent duplicate mutation requests.
- Confirm destructive actions.
- Provide useful user feedback.
- Refresh authoritative data after mutations.
- Avoid premature abstraction.
- Keep responsibilities clear between layers.

#### Status

**Frontend AD 19 — Accepted and implemented.**

This decision establishes the mutation-handling pattern used by the Stays module and provides a consistent foundation for future frontend modules that require CRUD operations.

---

### Frontend AD 20 — Row-Level CRUD Operation Isolation

#### Decision

HelloStay's Stays module will manage asynchronous CRUD operation state at the **individual stay level** rather than globally locking the entire Stays interface.

#### Context

The initial CRUD implementation used global operation states such as:

```text
isUpdating
isDeleting
```

These states indicate whether an update or delete request is currently running, but they do not identify which stay is being operated on.

A global lock could unnecessarily prevent interaction with unrelated stays.

For example:

```text
Stay A → Updating

Stay B → Edit
Stay B → Delete
```

There is no reason to prevent operations on Stay B simply because Stay A is being updated.

#### Decision Details

The Stays module therefore tracks the identity of the affected stay:

```text
updatingStayId
deletingStayId
```

The UI derives row-specific operation state from these values.

Conceptually:

```text
updatingStayId === stay.stay_id
        ↓
This particular stay is being updated.
```

and:

```text
deletingStayId === stay.stay_id
        ↓
This particular stay is being deleted.
```

#### Same-Stay Conflict Rule

The same stay must not be edited and deleted simultaneously.

Therefore:

```text
Editing Stay A
      ↓
Delete Stay A → Blocked
```

and:

```text
Deleting Stay A
      ↓
Edit Stay A → Blocked
```

This protects the UI from contradictory operations against the same backend record.

#### Different-Stay Independence Rule

Operations involving different stays remain independent.

For example:

```text
Stay A → Updating
Stay B → Deleting
```

is allowed because the operations target different records.

This provides better flexibility for the user without sacrificing protection against conflicting operations on the same record.

#### Stale State Protection

The UI must not continue displaying an edit form for a stay that no longer exists.

After successful deletion, the application checks whether the deleted stay is the stay currently represented by the edit state.

If so, the edit state is cleared.

```text
Delete Stay A
      ↓
Refresh stays
      ↓
Stay A no longer exists
      ↓
Clear editingStay
      ↓
Edit form disappears
```

#### Error and Cleanup Rule

Asynchronous operation state must always be cleaned up after the request finishes.

The implementation uses `finally` so that operation identifiers are cleared after both successful and failed requests.

```text
Request starts
      ↓
Set operation ID
      ↓
API request
      ↓
Success / Error
      ↓
finally
      ↓
Clear operation ID
```

This prevents a failed request from leaving a stay permanently disabled.

#### Architectural Boundaries

The decision maintains the existing HelloStay responsibility boundaries:

```text
React
    ↓
UI state and user interaction

stayService.js
    ↓
API communication

FastAPI
    ↓
Business logic, validation and persistence
```

The frontend does not move stay business rules into React or Electron.

#### Consequences

**Benefits:**

- Better user flexibility.
- Unrelated stays remain interactive.
- Same-stay conflicts are prevented.
- UI state accurately represents the affected record.
- Failed asynchronous operations can recover cleanly.
- The approach scales better than a global CRUD lock.

**Trade-off:**

The page requires additional state and row-level conditions compared with a simple global `isUpdating` / `isDeleting` approach.

This additional complexity is justified because it accurately represents the desired user interaction model.

#### Result

The Stays module follows a **row-level CRUD operation isolation strategy**, allowing independent operations on different stays while preventing conflicting operations on the same stay.

---

### Frontend AD 21 — GuestStay Read-Only Architecture

#### 1. Architecture Decision

**AD:** Frontend Architecture Decision 21
**Title:** GuestStay Read-Only Architecture
**Status:** Accepted
**Related Milestone:** M21 — GuestStay Read-Only Foundation

HelloStay will implement the initial GuestStay frontend as a **read-only React module backed by a dedicated GuestStay service**, while preserving the existing application routing, dashboard navigation, shared UI components, and FastAPI backend architecture.

#### 2. Context

GuestStay is a relationship between a Guest and a Stay.

The frontend therefore needs a dedicated representation of this relationship rather than treating GuestStay as a duplicate of either the Guests module or the Stays module.

M21 is the first GuestStay frontend milestone, so the architecture must establish a clean foundation without prematurely implementing functionality planned for later milestones.

#### 3. Decision

The GuestStay frontend will follow this structure:

```text
GuestStaysPage.jsx
       │
       ▼
guestStayService.js
       │
       ▼
FastAPI GuestStay API
```

The page is responsible for presentation and UI state.

The service is responsible for backend communication.

FastAPI remains responsible for business logic, validation, persistence, and API behavior.

#### 4. Separation of Responsibilities

##### React Renderer

React is responsible for:

* GuestStay screen rendering.
* UI state.
* Loading state.
* Error state.
* Empty state.
* Rendering returned GuestStay records.
* User interaction related to the current read-only screen.

##### GuestStay Service

The GuestStay service is responsible for:

* Sending requests to the GuestStay backend endpoint.
* Returning backend data to the React layer.
* Keeping API communication separate from UI components.

##### FastAPI Backend

FastAPI remains responsible for:

* Business rules.
* Validation.
* Database operations.
* GuestStay relationships.
* API response contracts.
* Backend errors.

##### Electron

Electron does not participate directly in GuestStay business logic.

No GuestStay business rules should be implemented in:

* Electron main process.
* Preload scripts.
* IPC handlers.

#### 5. Data Flow

The expected data flow is:

```text
User opens Guest Stays
          │
          ▼
GuestStaysPage mounts
          │
          ▼
useEffect starts initial request
          │
          ▼
guestStayService.js
          │
          ▼
FastAPI GuestStay endpoint
          │
          ▼
GuestStay response
          │
          ▼
GuestStaysPage state
          │
          ▼
Read-only table
```

#### 6. State Model

The page maintains three primary pieces of state:

```javascript
guestStays
isLoading
error
```

These states allow the UI to represent four meaningful situations:

```text
Loading
   │
   ├── Request fails ──► Error
   │
   └── Request succeeds
             │
             ├── Empty array ──► Empty
             │
             └── Records ──────► Success
```

This state model is intentionally simple because M21 only requires initial read-only functionality.

#### 7. Backend Contract Principle

The frontend will consume the fields provided by the FastAPI GuestStay response.

The M21 table uses:

```text
id
guest_id
stay_id
is_primary_guest
```

The frontend must not assume that additional information exists in the response.

For example, M21 does not invent:

* guest names,
* room numbers,
* stay dates,
* room types,
* other relationship information.

If such information is required in a future feature, the backend contract must support it appropriately.

#### 8. Read-Only First Principle

The first GuestStay milestone deliberately establishes a read-only foundation.

This prevents premature complexity.

M21 does not contain:

```text
Create
Edit
Delete
Assign
Search
Filter
Pagination
Sorting
```

These responsibilities are reserved for the appropriate future milestones.

#### 9. Shared UI Principle

GuestStay should reuse existing shared UI infrastructure wherever appropriate.

The module uses shared components such as:

```text
Card
Loading
ErrorMessage
```

For table presentation, generic classes were introduced:

```text
.table-wrapper
.data-table
```

This avoids unnecessarily duplicating identical table styles across modules.

#### 10. Avoid Module-Specific Duplication

GuestStay should not copy Stays-specific styling simply because Stays already contains a table.

Instead:

```text
Generic table behavior
        │
        ▼
Shared CSS
```

while:

```text
Module-specific behavior
        │
        ▼
Module-specific CSS
```

This distinction prevents the global stylesheet from becoming filled with duplicated styles.

#### 11. React Effect Cleanup

The initial API request uses `useEffect()` with a cleanup mechanism.

The purpose is to prevent an asynchronous response from attempting to update state after the component has been unmounted.

This establishes a safer pattern for future asynchronous React operations.

#### 12. Response Validation

The frontend validates that the service returns an array before storing the result.

This creates a small defensive boundary between:

```text
External/API data
        │
        ▼
Frontend state
```

Unexpected response structures should not silently propagate into rendering logic.

#### 13. React Key Decision

GuestStay records use:

```javascript
guestStay.id
```

as the React list key.

The record identifier is preferred because it represents the identity of the actual GuestStay entity.

Array indexes should not be used when a stable entity identifier is available.

#### 14. Electron Decision

No Electron architecture changes are required for M21.

The feature does not require:

* native filesystem access,
* native OS integration,
* desktop menus,
* IPC,
* preload API changes,
* main-process business logic.

Therefore the implementation remains inside the React renderer and backend layers.

#### 15. Architectural Boundaries

The following boundaries must remain intact:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Electron Main Process       │
│ Desktop responsibilities    │
└──────────────┬──────────────┘
               │
               │ secure bridge when required
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ React Renderer              │
│ UI + state + interaction    │
└──────────────┬──────────────┘
               │
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Frontend Services           │
│ API communication           │
└──────────────┬──────────────┘
               │
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ FastAPI Backend             │
│ Business logic + data       │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

M21 does not change this architecture.

#### 16. Consequences

##### Positive Consequences

* Clear separation of concerns.
* Easy-to-understand React components.
* API logic remains reusable.
* FastAPI remains the source of truth.
* GuestStay can evolve independently.
* Shared UI infrastructure can be reused.
* Future CRUD functionality can be added incrementally.
* Electron remains free from unnecessary business logic.

##### Trade-Offs

The read-only implementation does not provide complete GuestStay management functionality.

This is intentional.

The architecture prioritizes:

```text
Correct foundation
      >
Premature completeness
```

#### 17. Future Extension

Future GuestStay functionality should extend this foundation rather than replace it.

The expected progression is:

```text
M21
Read-only foundation
       │
       ▼
M22
Create + Guest Assignment
       │
       ▼
M23
Edit + Delete
       │
       ▼
M24
UX Refinement + Code Cleanup
```

Each milestone should add only the responsibilities planned for that milestone.

#### 18. Rejected Approaches

##### Putting API Calls Directly Everywhere

Rejected because it couples UI components tightly to backend communication.

##### Putting GuestStay Business Logic in React

Rejected because FastAPI is the source of truth for business logic.

##### Putting GuestStay Logic in Electron

Rejected because Electron is responsible for desktop capabilities, not hotel business rules.

##### Copying the Stays Table CSS

Rejected because GuestStay requires reusable table styling rather than duplication of Stays-specific styles.

##### Implementing CRUD in M21

Rejected because it violates the planned milestone boundaries and introduces unnecessary complexity before the read-only foundation is established.

#### 19. Architectural Principles Reinforced

M21 reinforces these HelloStay principles:

* Backend remains the source of truth.
* React owns presentation and UI state.
* Services own API communication.
* Electron owns desktop concerns.
* Shared UI infrastructure should be reused.
* Modules should have clear responsibilities.
* Features should be implemented incrementally.
* Architecture decisions should be respected across milestones.
* Do not introduce future functionality prematurely.

#### 20. Final Decision

The GuestStay frontend will remain based on:

```text
Dedicated GuestStay service
          +
Read-only React page
          +
Shared UI components
          +
Shared table foundation
          +
Existing dashboard routing
          +
FastAPI as source of truth
```

This architecture is accepted as the foundation for subsequent GuestStay milestones.

**AD21 Status: ACCEPTED**

### Frontend AD 22 — GuestStay Creation Through Existing Entity Selection

#### Status

**Accepted**

#### Context

HelloStay represents the relationship between a Guest and a Stay through the GuestStay junction model.

The backend architecture explicitly separates Guest identity from Stay records and uses GuestStay to represent their relationship.

The backend GuestStay model supports:

```text
Guest
  ↕
GuestStay
  ↕
Stay
```

and includes `is_primary_guest` to identify the Primary Guest associated with a Stay.

The frontend already established a read-only GuestStay page in Milestone 21.

Milestone 22 required the first GuestStay mutation workflow.

The frontend therefore needed an architectural decision for:

* Selecting existing Guests.
* Selecting existing Stays.
* Building the GuestStay payload.
* Sending the creation request.
* Handling validation.
* Handling mutation state.
* Refreshing the GuestStay collection.
* Keeping the backend as the source of truth.

#### Decision

The GuestStay module will create relationships by selecting existing Guest and Stay records rather than creating or modifying those entities during GuestStay creation.

`GuestStaysPage.jsx` will own:

* Form state.
* User interaction.
* Basic client-side validation.
* Submission state.
* Success feedback.
* Submission error feedback.
* GuestStay list refresh orchestration.

`guestStayService.js` will own GuestStay API operations.

`apiClient.js` will continue to own shared HTTP communication.

FastAPI will remain the authoritative source of:

* GuestStay validation.
* Relationship persistence.
* Business rules.
* Database integrity.
* API response contracts.

The accepted communication flow is:

```text
GuestStaysPage.jsx
        ↓
guestStayService.js
        ↓
apiClient.js
        ↓
FastAPI
        ↓
GuestStay database relationship
```

#### Backend Contract

GuestStay creation uses:

```text
POST /guest-stays
```

The frontend sends:

```json
{
  "guest_id": 12,
  "stay_id": 7,
  "is_primary_guest": false
}
```

The backend schema defines:

```text
guest_id: int
stay_id: int
is_primary_guest: bool
```

The frontend therefore converts HTML selection values to numbers before submission.

#### Existing Guest Selection Decision

The GuestStay form will use the existing Guest collection.

Guest data is retrieved through:

```text
guestService.js
        ↓
GET /guests
```

The frontend uses:

```text
guest.id
```

as the Guest identifier.

The user-facing selector displays:

```text
guest.guest_name
```

The GuestStay workflow does not create a new Guest.

This preserves the architectural distinction between:

```text
Guest identity
```

and:

```text
Guest–Stay relationship
```

#### Existing Stay Selection Decision

The GuestStay form will use the existing Stay collection.

Stay data is retrieved through:

```text
stayService.js
        ↓
GET /stay
```

The frontend uses:

```text
stay.stay_id
```

as the Stay identifier.

The selector provides additional contextual information such as:

```text
Stay ID
Room ID
Stay status
```

The GuestStay workflow does not create or modify the selected Stay.

#### Primary Guest Decision

The GuestStay form exposes:

```text
is_primary_guest
```

through a controlled checkbox.

The corresponding React state is:

```text
isPrimaryGuest
```

The frontend sends the boolean value to the backend.

The frontend does not implement billing rules or independently determine the business meaning of Primary Guest.

It only collects the value defined by the backend contract.

#### Controlled Form Decision

The GuestStay form uses controlled React inputs.

The following values are maintained by React:

```text
selectedGuestId
selectedStayId
isPrimaryGuest
```

The flow is:

```text
User interaction
      ↓
React event handler
      ↓
State update
      ↓
Controlled input value
```

This gives the component a predictable source of truth for the form.

#### Validation Decision

The frontend performs basic validation before submitting the request.

The following are required:

```text
Guest
Stay
```

If either is missing:

* The request is not sent.
* A user-facing validation message is displayed.
* The submission state does not begin.

Frontend validation exists for usability.

Backend validation remains authoritative.

This preserves the principle:

```text
Frontend validation
        ↓
Immediate user feedback

Backend validation
        ↓
Authoritative correctness
```

#### Submission State Decision

GuestStay creation uses a dedicated:

```text
isSubmitting
```

state.

While the request is active:

* The submit button is disabled.
* The button communicates that creation is in progress.
* Duplicate submissions are prevented.

The GuestStay form does not use the general page-loading state to represent mutation activity.

This keeps:

```text
Initial data loading
```

separate from:

```text
GuestStay creation
```

#### Error State Decision

GuestStay creation uses:

```text
submitError
```

for mutation-specific errors.

The existing page-level loading error remains responsible for initial GuestStay collection loading.

This keeps errors tied to the operation that actually failed.

The architecture therefore distinguishes:

```text
Page load error
        ≠
GuestStay creation error
```

This follows the same operation-specific state principle already established elsewhere in the frontend.

#### Success Feedback Decision

Successful GuestStay creation produces explicit success feedback.

The page uses the existing HelloStay alert styling rather than introducing a new notification system.

The success state is represented through:

```text
successMessage
```

The success message is displayed after the relationship has been successfully created and the updated GuestStay collection has been retrieved.

#### Collection Refresh Decision

After successful creation, the GuestStay collection will be fetched again.

The selected approach is:

```text
POST /guest-stays
       ↓
Successful creation
       ↓
GET /guest-stays
       ↓
Replace GuestStay state
```

The frontend will not rely on an optimistic local append for this milestone.

#### Reason for Refetching

Refetching keeps the frontend aligned with the backend source of truth.

The frontend does not need to assume:

* How the backend stores the relationship.
* Whether the backend modifies returned values.
* Whether additional records or ordering changes exist.
* How the backend ultimately represents the newly created relationship.

The backend collection remains authoritative.

#### Refresh Helper Decision

The GuestStay retrieval operation used after mutation is encapsulated in a small helper:

```text
loadGuestStays()
```

The helper retrieves the collection and verifies that the response is an array.

This prevents duplication of the request and response-validation logic.

The abstraction remains deliberately small.

A generic data-fetching hook is not required for this workflow.

#### API Response Validation Decision

The frontend verifies that collection responses are arrays before storing them.

This protects the page from unexpected backend responses.

Without this validation, a response such as:

```text
null
object
string
```

could eventually cause rendering errors when the page executes:

```text
guestStays.map(...)
```

Response validation therefore forms a defensive boundary between external data and React rendering.

#### Service Layer Decision

GuestStay API operations remain inside:

```text
guestStayService.js
```

The service currently provides:

```text
getGuestStays()
createGuestStay()
```

The page does not call `fetch()` directly.

This keeps GuestStay HTTP behavior consistent with:

```text
roomService.js
guestService.js
stayService.js
```

and preserves the established domain-service architecture.

#### Central API Client Decision

`apiClient.js` remains the single shared HTTP mechanism.

The GuestStay service does not duplicate:

* API base URL logic.
* Headers.
* JSON serialization.
* Response parsing.
* HTTP error conversion.
* Network error conversion.

The architecture remains:

```text
Domain service
      ↓
Central API client
      ↓
FastAPI
```

#### React Renderer Responsibility

The GuestStay workflow belongs entirely to the React renderer for normal application behavior.

React is responsible for:

* Rendering the form.
* Managing controlled input values.
* Managing local UI state.
* Handling user interaction.
* Performing basic client-side validation.
* Calling the GuestStay service.
* Displaying loading feedback.
* Displaying success feedback.
* Displaying mutation errors.
* Rendering the updated GuestStay collection.

#### FastAPI Responsibility

FastAPI remains responsible for:

* GuestStay request validation.
* GuestStay relationship persistence.
* Database operations.
* Backend business rules.
* Relationship integrity.
* Response generation.

React does not become a second backend.

#### Electron Responsibility

No Electron code is required for GuestStay creation.

Electron remains responsible for:

* Desktop lifecycle.
* Native window management.
* Startup behavior.
* Future desktop integrations.

Electron main does not contain GuestStay API logic.

Preload and IPC do not participate in ordinary GuestStay HTTP requests.

The boundary remains:

```text
Electron Main
      ↓
Desktop shell

Preload / IPC
      ↓
Controlled desktop capabilities

React Renderer
      ↓
GuestStay UI and API communication

FastAPI
      ↓
GuestStay business logic
```

#### Styling Decision

GuestStay-specific form styling will reuse the existing global UI foundation.

Existing classes are preferred for:

```text
Cards
Form fields
Buttons
Alerts
Tables
Empty states
```

GuestStay-specific classes are used only where the page needs unique layout behavior.

This prevents unnecessary global CSS duplication.

#### Maintainability Decision

The implementation favors explicit state and readable handlers over premature abstraction.

The current GuestStay workflow is small enough that introducing:

* Redux
* Zustand
* Context
* Generic CRUD hooks
* Generic form frameworks
* Generic mutation abstractions

would add complexity without solving an immediate problem.

The architecture can be reconsidered when the GuestStay module becomes significantly more complex.

#### Alternatives Considered

##### Create Guest During GuestStay Creation

Rejected.

A GuestStay form should connect existing entities.

Combining Guest creation and relationship creation would mix two domain responsibilities and make validation and error handling more complicated.

##### Create Stay During GuestStay Creation

Rejected.

Stay creation is an independent workflow and should remain controlled by the Stays module.

##### Call `fetch()` Directly from `GuestStaysPage.jsx`

Rejected.

This would bypass the established service layer and central API client.

##### Call FastAPI Through Electron IPC

Rejected.

GuestStay HTTP communication is normal renderer-to-backend communication and does not require desktop privileges.

IPC should remain reserved for controlled desktop capabilities.

##### Use Global State Management

Rejected for the current workflow.

Guest, Stay, and GuestStay data are required by this page but do not currently justify a global state library.

##### Optimistically Append the Created GuestStay

Rejected for this milestone.

Refetching provides a simpler and more authoritative synchronization strategy.

##### Introduce a Generic CRUD Hook

Rejected.

The GuestStay workflow is intentionally small and the explicit implementation is easier to understand, debug, and maintain.

#### Consequences

##### Positive Consequences

* Guest and Stay responsibilities remain separate.
* GuestStay relationships are explicitly represented.
* API communication remains centralized.
* FastAPI remains the source of truth.
* The form is predictable because it uses controlled inputs.
* Required fields are validated before unnecessary requests.
* Duplicate submissions are prevented.
* Successful relationships are immediately reflected in the list.
* Backend-generated data remains authoritative.
* Error messages remain associated with the correct operation.
* GuestStay styling remains consistent with the rest of HelloStay.
* The implementation remains understandable for the current learning stage.
* Future GuestStay mutation operations can reuse the same service boundary.

##### Trade-offs

* Creating a GuestStay requires an additional `GET /guest-stays` request after the successful POST.
* `GuestStaysPage.jsx` contains additional local form and mutation state.
* Guest and Stay collections must be loaded before the creation form can be used.
* The GuestStay page currently uses direct page-level orchestration rather than extracting a separate form component.
* The implementation does not yet optimize for large Guest or Stay collections.

These trade-offs are acceptable for the current milestone.

#### Explicit Non-Decisions

The following were intentionally not introduced:

```text
GuestStay update
GuestStay delete
GuestStay detail editing
GuestStay filtering
GuestStay pagination
Guest search
Stay search
Guest history
Check-in
Check-out
Stay lifecycle management
Room status automation
Billing
Payment processing
Booking workflow
Optimistic synchronization
Global GuestStay state
Electron IPC
Electron backend startup
Electron packaging
```

These concerns remain outside Frontend AD 22.

#### Future Reconsideration Triggers

This decision may be revisited when:

* GuestStay editing is introduced.
* GuestStay deletion is introduced.
* GuestStay collections become large.
* Search or filtering becomes necessary.
* Multiple pages require shared GuestStay state.
* GuestStay history is implemented.
* Billing consumes Primary Guest relationships.
* Check-in/check-out workflows depend on GuestStay.
* The GuestStay form becomes large enough to justify component extraction.
* Backend APIs introduce more complex relationship validation.
* Optimistic updates become necessary for UX performance.

#### Final Decision Summary

HelloStay will implement GuestStay creation by selecting existing Guest and Stay records and submitting their identifiers through the established GuestStay service layer.

The final architecture is:

```text
Existing Guest
      +
Existing Stay
      +
Primary Guest selection
      ↓
GuestStaysPage.jsx
      ↓
guestStayService.js
      ↓
apiClient.js
      ↓
POST /guest-stays
      ↓
FastAPI
      ↓
Database
      ↓
GET /guest-stays
      ↓
Updated GuestStay list
```

This decision preserves the separation between Guest identity, Stay records, and GuestStay relationships.

It also preserves the project's central architectural principle:

```text
React manages the interface.
Services manage API operations.
FastAPI manages business truth.
Electron manages the desktop shell.
```

The GuestStay module is therefore ready for future relationship-management functionality without requiring a redesign of the current architecture.

## Frontend Milestone Plan and Recommended Milestone Order

### Purpose

This section is the authoritative frontend implementation roadmap for HelloStay.

It combines:

- The recommended implementation order.
- The purpose of each milestone.
- The current milestone status.
- The dependency between milestones.
- The relationship between React, Electron, and the FastAPI backend.

The milestone roadmap must always be interpreted together with:

- Frontend Design for V1
- Frontend Architecture Decisions
- Current backend API contracts
- Product V1 scope
- Completed frontend milestone history

The frontend must continue from the actual current project state and must not recreate completed functionality unnecessarily.

FastAPI remains the source of truth for business logic, validation, persistence, authentication, authorization, and hotel workflows.

React remains responsible for UI rendering, forms, navigation, UI state, and user interaction.

Electron remains responsible for the desktop shell, application lifecycle, native desktop integration, backend process management, and packaging.

### Milestone Execution Rules

Every new milestone session must:

1. Read the current `PROJECT_NOTES.md`.
2. Review the completed milestone history.
3. Review the relevant Architecture Decisions.
4. Review the Frontend Design for V1.
5. Review the actual current project files.
6. Confirm that the previous milestone is complete.
7. Verify the required backend API contract.
8. Implement only the current milestone scope.
9. Preserve previously completed functionality.
10. Avoid implementing functionality assigned to later milestones.

If a milestone depends on a backend capability that does not exist:

- Do not invent the endpoint.
- Do not create fake business logic in React.
- Do not move business logic into Electron.
- Identify the backend dependency.
- Stop or adjust the milestone only after the dependency is understood.

---

### Important Terminology Rule

The current backend uses `Stay` as the operational entity.

The frontend must not assume that `Stay` and a future Booking/Reservation entity are interchangeable.

A dedicated Booking/Reservation module should only be introduced if the backend provides an appropriate API contract and the feature is explicitly included in the V1 implementation scope.

Therefore, the old milestone terminology:

- Bookings Management
- Booking Lifecycle Actions

must not be used as current implementation milestones unless the backend contract and project scope are explicitly changed.

---

### Milestone Status Rule

A milestone is considered **Completed** only after:

- Its implementation scope has been completed.
- The application has been verified.
- No known blocking issue remains.
- The milestone's architectural implications have been documented.
- The next milestone has been identified.

The completed milestone history is the historical source of truth.

The remaining milestone list is the future implementation source of truth.

## The Current Frontend Project State is the present-state source of truth.

## Completed Frontend Milestones

### Frontend Milestone 0 — Frontend Orientation, Backend Contract Review, and Architecture Boundary Confirmation

**Status:** Completed
**Date Recorded:** 2026-06-29

Frontend orientation was completed before writing new React/Electron frontend code.

**What was completed:**

- Reviewed the current HelloStay backend files before starting the frontend rebuild.
- Confirmed that the frontend must be built from actual backend API contracts, not assumptions.
- Confirmed that FastAPI remains the source of truth for business logic, validation, authentication, database operations, and hotel workflow rules.
- Confirmed that React is responsible for renderer UI only: screens, forms, components, routing, loading states, error states, and API calls.
- Confirmed that Electron is responsible for desktop shell behavior only: app window, lifecycle, startup flow, native desktop integration, and packaging.
- Confirmed that preload/IPC should be used only for safe desktop communication when React needs controlled access to Electron functionality.
- Reviewed the currently registered backend routers.
- Confirmed that the backend currently supports Health Check, System Info, Rooms, Guests, Stays, and Guest-Stays.
- Confirmed that the backend currently exposes CRUD-style APIs for Rooms, Guests, Stays, and Guest-Stays.
- Confirmed that the backend has JWT/security helper utilities and token schemas, but no registered authentication router was visible in the uploaded `main.py`.
- Confirmed that real frontend authentication should not be implemented until backend auth routes exist.
- Confirmed that the current backend uses `Stay`, not `Booking`, so the frontend should use `Stay` internally until a true booking/reservation API exists.
- Confirmed that the first frontend-backend integration should be the backend health check using `GET /`.
- Confirmed that the frontend should use a central API client instead of scattered `fetch()` calls.
- Confirmed that future frontend folders should be feature-based, not random or prematurely over-structured.
- Recorded the following architecture decisions from this milestone:
  - Backend contract first.
  - FastAPI remains the source of truth.
  - React is the renderer UI layer.
  - Electron is the desktop shell only.
  - Preload/IPC is only for safe desktop access.
  - A central API client is required.
  - A feature-based folder structure should be used.
  - Real auth must wait until backend auth API exists.
  - Use backend term `Stay` internally.
  - First API integration must be the backend health check.
  - Build Rooms before Guests, Guests before Stays.
  - Dashboard should not be built first.
  - Finance must eventually come from backend-calculated APIs.

**Final approved source structure:**
No frontend source structure was created or modified during this milestone.

Milestone 0 was a planning and orientation milestone only.

Approved future direction:
frontend/
src/
features/
startup/
rooms/
guests/
stays/
guestStays/
shared/
components/
services/
hooks/
utils/

**Files reviewed and approved:**

- Backend `main.py`
- Backend room API file
- Backend guest API file
- Backend stay API file
- Backend guest-stay API file
- Backend system-info API file
- Backend security utility file
- Backend token schema file
- Backend database connection/session/base files
- Backend Room model
- Backend Guest model
- Backend Stay model
- Backend GuestStay model
- Backend SystemInfo model
- Backend Room schema
- Backend Guest schema
- Backend Stay schema
- Backend GuestStay schema
- Existing `PROJECT_NOTES.md`

**Why this milestone matters:**
This milestone prevents the frontend rebuild from starting with guesses, fake APIs, or premature UI decisions.

It establishes the correct engineering direction before implementation:

- The backend API contract drives frontend development.
- React must not contain backend business rules.
- Electron must not become a second backend.
- The preload layer must remain secure and limited.
- Frontend modules must be built in dependency order.
- Authentication must not be faked before backend support exists.
- The first integration must be small, real, and testable.

This milestone protects the project from rebuilding the deleted frontend blindly and keeps the new implementation understandable for learning.

**Backend/API contracts involved:**

Current backend APIs confirmed:

- `GET /`
- `GET /system-info`

Rooms:

- `POST /rooms`
- `GET /rooms`
- `GET /rooms/{room_id}`
- `PUT /rooms/{room_id}`
- `DELETE /rooms/{room_id}`

Guests:

- `POST /guests`
- `GET /guests`
- `GET /guests/{guest_id}`
- `PUT /guests/{guest_id}`
- `DELETE /guests/{guest_id}`

Stays:

- `POST /stay`
- `GET /stay`
- `GET /stay/{stay_id}`
- `PUT /stay/{stay_id}`
- `DELETE /stay/{stay_id}`

Guest-Stays:

- `POST /guest-stays`
- `GET /guest-stays`
- `GET /guest-stays/{guest_stay_id}`
- `PUT /guest-stays/{guest_stay_id}`
- `DELETE /guest-stays/{guest_stay_id}`

Backend/API gaps identified:

- No registered auth router was visible in the uploaded backend entry file.
- No confirmed register endpoint.
- No confirmed login endpoint.
- No confirmed current-user/session endpoint.
- No dashboard summary endpoint.
- No finance summary endpoint.
- No true `/bookings` API.
- No available-room search endpoint.
- No dedicated check-in/check-out workflow endpoints.

**What was intentionally deferred:**

- Writing React code
- Writing Electron code
- Creating frontend folders
- Creating reusable components
- Creating API service files
- Creating routing
- Creating authentication UI
- Creating dashboard UI
- Creating rooms UI
- Creating guests UI
- Creating stays/bookings UI
- Creating finance/history UI
- Creating shared state/context
- Creating custom hooks
- Creating preload/IPC APIs
- Starting FastAPI from Electron
- Packaging the desktop app

**Cleanup performed:**
No code cleanup was performed because this milestone did not modify source files.

Planning cleanup was performed by separating confirmed backend-supported features from future or missing features.

Confirmed as currently supported:

- Health check
- System info
- Rooms
- Guests
- Stays
- Guest-Stays

Marked as pending or future backend support:

- Authentication
- Dashboard summary
- Finance summary
- True bookings/reservations
- Available-room search
- Dedicated check-in/check-out workflow

**Debugging/learning conclusion:**
Before building a frontend feature, always inspect the backend route, schema, model, and response shape.

Do not guess endpoint names or field names.

For HelloStay, frontend debugging should start with the smallest possible full-stack check:
React Start Page
↓
systemApi
↓
apiClient
↓
GET /
↓
FastAPI health check response

This confirms that React, FastAPI, CORS, and the API client are working before any hotel module is added.

**Next milestone:**
Frontend Milestone 1 — React Project Setup.

---

### Frontend Milestone 1 — React Project Setup

**Status:** Completed
**Date Recorded:** 2026-06-29

React frontend setup was completed using Vite with JavaScript.

**What was completed:**

- Created a new React frontend using Vite.
- Used JavaScript instead of TypeScript.
- Created a minimal root React app.
- Added `src/main.jsx` as the React entry point.
- Added `src/App.jsx` as the root component.
- Added `src/styles/global.css` for basic global styling.
- Configured Vite to run on port `5173`.
- Enabled `strictPort: true` so Vite does not silently switch ports.
- Removed unused Vite starter files and assets.
- Kept the frontend free of feature logic.

**Final approved source structure:**
frontend/
src/
main.jsx
App.jsx
styles/
global.css

**Files reviewed and approved:**

- `frontend/src/App.jsx`
- `frontend/src/main.jsx`
- `frontend/src/styles/global.css`
- `frontend/vite.config.js`

**Why this milestone matters:**
This milestone establishes a clean React renderer foundation before Electron, routing, authentication, API services, or hotel modules are introduced. It keeps the frontend rebuild understandable and prevents premature architecture decisions.

**Backend/API contracts involved:**
No backend API integration was implemented. However, the frontend port was aligned with the backend CORS configuration, which currently allows `http://localhost:5173`.

**What was intentionally deferred:**

- Electron desktop shell
- React Router
- API services
- Authentication
- Dashboard
- Rooms module
- Guests module
- Stays/bookings module
- Finance/history
- Feature components
- Shared context/state management
- Custom hooks
- Utility modules

**Cleanup performed:**

- Removed unused default Vite CSS files.
- Removed unused starter image assets.
- Avoided creating empty future folders such as `components`, `pages`, `routes`, `services`, `hooks`, `context`, and `utils`.

**Debugging/learning conclusion:**
When checking project structure, avoid listing `node_modules` because it contains dependency files and creates noisy output. Prefer:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem .\src -Recurse -File | Select-Object FullName
```

**Next milestone:**
Frontend Milestone 2 — Electron Desktop Shell Setup.

---

### Frontend Milestone 2 — Electron Desktop Shell Setup

**Status:** Completed
**Milestone Number:** 2
**Layer:** Desktop / Frontend Shell
**Technology Used:** Electron, Vite, React, JavaScript

#### Objective

Set up the basic Electron desktop shell around the existing Vite React frontend without adding hotel features, routing, authentication, backend integration, packaging, or business logic.

The goal of this milestone was to make HelloStay open as a desktop application while keeping React as the renderer process and Electron as the desktop shell.

#### Completed Work

- Installed Electron as the desktop runtime.

- Installed `concurrently` to run Vite and Electron together during development.

- Installed `wait-on` to wait for the Vite dev server before launching Electron.

- Created the Electron main process file:
  frontend/electron/main.js

- Created the Electron preload file:
  frontend/electron/preload.js

- Configured Electron to create a secure `BrowserWindow`.

- Configured Electron to load the Vite React app from:
  http://localhost:5173

- Kept `nodeIntegration` disabled.

- Kept `contextIsolation` enabled.

- Added Electron development scripts in `package.json`.

- Verified that the React app opens inside a native Electron desktop window.

#### Files Added

frontend/electron/main.js
frontend/electron/preload.js

#### Files Updated

frontend/package.json

#### Final Electron Main Process Responsibility

The Electron main process is responsible only for desktop application lifecycle concerns:

- Starting the Electron app.
- Creating the main desktop window.
- Loading the React Vite development server during development.
- Preparing for future production loading from the React build output.
- Handling macOS activate behavior.
- Quitting the app on non-macOS platforms when all windows are closed.

The Electron main process does not contain hotel business logic, database logic, authentication logic, API logic, room logic, booking logic, guest logic, or financial logic.

#### Final Preload Responsibility

The preload file exists as a future secure bridge between Electron and React.

For this milestone, the preload file intentionally exposes nothing.

No IPC, desktop APIs, filesystem access, or backend logic were added.

#### Development Script Setup

The project now supports running the desktop app during development using:

```bash
npm run desktop
```

The development script starts:
Vite React dev server
Electron desktop shell

Electron waits for Vite to become available before opening the desktop window.

#### Important Security Decisions Preserved

- React renderer does not get direct Node.js access.
- Electron APIs are not exposed directly to React.
- `nodeIntegration` remains disabled.
- `contextIsolation` remains enabled.
- Preload remains empty until a real desktop capability is needed.
- Backend business logic remains in FastAPI.
- Database operations remain outside React and Electron.

#### What Was Intentionally Not Added

The following were intentionally excluded from this milestone:

- React Router
- Authentication
- Dashboard
- Rooms module
- Guests module
- Stays module
- Bookings module
- Finance module
- History module
- API service layer
- FastAPI backend startup from Electron
- SQLite access from Electron
- IPC communication
- App packaging
- Installer setup
- Production build configuration beyond a basic future loading branch

#### Verification Result

The command:

```bash
npm run desktop
```

successfully opened the HelloStay React frontend inside an Electron desktop window.

#### Summary

Milestone 2 successfully introduced Electron as the desktop shell for HelloStay while preserving a clean architecture:

Electron main process → desktop lifecycle
React renderer → user interface
Preload script → future safe bridge
FastAPI backend → business logic and API contracts
SQLite database → persistence

This milestone completed the basic desktop foundation without mixing frontend UI, desktop lifecycle, backend logic, or database responsibilities.

---

### Frontend Milestone 3: Startup Flow and Routing

**Status:** Completed
**Date Completed:** 2026-06-30
**Project:** HelloStay — Offline Hotel Management System
**Frontend Stack:** React, JavaScript, Vite
**Desktop Shell:** Electron

#### 1. Milestone Objective

The objective of Milestone 3 was to introduce a clean startup flow and basic routing structure inside the React renderer process.

This milestone focused only on navigation between minimal placeholder pages. No hotel features, backend integration, authentication, dashboard layout, protected routes, Electron backend startup, or packaging logic were added.

#### 2. Scope of This Milestone

Milestone 3 included:

- Installing React Router DOM.
- Creating a clean routing structure.
- Creating a minimal `StartPage`.
- Creating a minimal `LoginPage` placeholder.
- Creating a `NotFoundPage` fallback route.
- Setting up routing through `BrowserRouter`.
- Moving route definitions into a dedicated `AppRoutes.jsx` file.
- Making the app open on the startup page.
- Adding a button on the startup page that navigates to the login page.

#### 3. Out of Scope

The following were intentionally not added:

- Real authentication.
- Login form.
- JWT handling.
- Auth state.
- Protected routes.
- Dashboard routes.
- Dashboard layout.
- Rooms module.
- Guests module.
- Stays or bookings module.
- Finance module.
- History module.
- Settings module.
- Backend API calls.
- FastAPI startup from Electron.
- Electron packaging.

This was intentional because the milestone was only about routing foundation.

#### 4. Final Route Structure

The app now supports the following routes:
/ → StartPage
/login → LoginPage

-          → NotFoundPage

The `*` route acts as a fallback for unknown paths.

Example:
/random-page → NotFoundPage

#### 5. Final Folder Structure

The frontend now follows this structure:
frontend/
src/
main.jsx
App.jsx

    routes/
      AppRoutes.jsx

    pages/
      StartPage.jsx
      LoginPage.jsx
      NotFoundPage.jsx

    styles/
      global.css

#### 6. Files Added

The following files were added:
src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx
src/pages/StartPage.jsx
src/pages/LoginPage.jsx
src/pages/NotFoundPage.jsx

#### 7. Files Updated

The following files were updated:
src/main.jsx
src/App.jsx
src/styles/global.css

#### 8. Implementation Summary

`main.jsx` now wraps the React application with `BrowserRouter`.

main.jsx
↓
BrowserRouter
↓
App.jsx
↓
AppRoutes.jsx
↓
Page components

`App.jsx` was kept small and only renders `AppRoutes`.

`AppRoutes.jsx` owns all route definitions.

The startup page contains a button that uses `useNavigate` to move the user to `/login`.

The login page is only a placeholder.

The not-found page uses `Link` to return to the startup page.

#### 9. Responsibilities After This Milestone

#### React Renderer Process

React owns:

- Page rendering.
- Route definitions.
- Client-side navigation.
- Startup page.
- Login placeholder page.
- Fallback route.

#### Electron Main Process

Electron owns:

- Desktop window creation.
- App lifecycle.
- Loading the React app.
- Desktop shell behavior.

Electron does not know about React routes such as `/login`.

#### FastAPI Backend

FastAPI remains responsible for:

- Business logic.
- Validation.
- Database operations.
- API contracts.
- Authentication logic later.

No backend integration was added in this milestone.

#### 10. Key Concepts Learned

This milestone introduced the following concepts:

- Routing in a React single-page application.
- Difference between client-side navigation and full page reload.
- Why Electron desktop apps can still use React Router.
- Why routes belong in the React renderer process.
- What `BrowserRouter` does.
- What `Routes` does.
- What `Route` does.
- What `Link` does.
- What `useNavigate` does.
- Why authentication and protected routes should wait for later milestones.

#### 11. Verification Steps Completed

The following URLs were verified:
http://localhost:5173/
http://localhost:5173/login
http://localhost:5173/random-page

Expected results:
/ shows StartPage
/login shows LoginPage
/random-page shows NotFoundPage

The app was also verified through Electron using:

```bash
npm run desktop
```

#### 12. Milestone Result

Milestone 3 was completed successfully.

HelloStay now has a clean routing foundation inside the React renderer process while preserving the separation between React, Electron, and FastAPI.

#### 13. Suggested Next Milestone

The recommended next milestone is:
Frontend Milestone 4: Authentication UI Foundation

Milestone 4 should still avoid real backend authentication at first. It should focus on creating a clean login page UI structure, basic form state, input handling, and frontend-only validation concepts before connecting to the FastAPI authentication API.

---

### Frontend Milestone 4 Notes: UI Foundation and Layout System

#### Milestone Name

Frontend Milestone 4 — UI Foundation and Layout System

#### Milestone Status

Completed / Ready to Implement

#### Purpose of This Milestone

The purpose of Milestone 4 is to create the basic visual foundation for the HelloStay React frontend.

This milestone does not build hotel features. It prepares the frontend so future screens can be built consistently using reusable UI components and shared styling rules.

The focus is on:

- CSS variables
- Global styling organization
- Reusable UI components
- Basic placeholder page improvement
- Renderer-only UI responsibilities

#### What Was Already Completed Before This Milestone

#### Milestone 1

- React frontend was created using Vite.
- JavaScript was selected instead of TypeScript.
- The app runs on `http://localhost:5173`.
- A clean minimal frontend structure was created.
- No feature logic was added.

#### Milestone 2

- Electron was installed.
- A basic Electron desktop shell was created.
- Electron opens the Vite React app in a desktop window.
- Electron main process, preload script, and renderer process responsibilities were separated.
- `nodeIntegration` remains disabled.
- `contextIsolation` remains enabled.
- No backend startup, packaging, authentication, routing, or hotel features were added.

#### Milestone 3

- React Router was introduced.
- A basic routing structure was created.
- `AppRoutes.jsx` was created.
- `StartPage`, `LoginPage`, and `NotFoundPage` were created.
- The app can navigate from the start page to the login page.

- Guests module
- Stays module
- Bookings module
- Finance module
- History module
- Settings module
- Electron backend startup
- App packaging
- Tailwind CSS
- UI libraries
- Icon libraries
- Animation libraries

#### Final Folder Direction

```txt
frontend/
  src/
    components/
      ui/
        Button.jsx
        Input.jsx
        Card.jsx
        Loading.jsx
        ErrorMessage.jsx

    pages/
      StartPage.jsx
      LoginPage.jsx
      NotFoundPage.jsx

    routes/
      AppRoutes.jsx

    styles/
      global.css
```

#### Key Concept: Design System

A design system is a reusable set of visual rules and UI building blocks.

In this milestone, the design system is intentionally small.

It includes:

- Colors
- Spacing
- Border radius
- Shadows
- Font family
- Button styles
- Input styles
- Card styles
- Error styles
- Loading styles

The goal is not to create a complete enterprise design system yet. The goal is to avoid duplicated visual decisions and create a consistent foundation.

#### Key Concept: CSS Variables

CSS variables are reusable values defined in CSS.

Example:

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #2563eb;
}
```

Then they can be reused like this:

```css
.ui-button--primary {
  background: var(--color-primary);
}
```

This helps avoid repeated hard-coded values.

Instead of writing the same color many times, we define it once and reuse it.

#### Key Concept: Reusable UI Components

Reusable UI components are small React components that can be used across many screens.

Examples:

```txt
Button
Input
Card
Loading
ErrorMessage
```

Instead of every page writing its own button style, every page can use:

```jsx
<Button>Save</Button>
```

This improves consistency and makes future changes easier.

#### Key Concept: Page Components vs UI Components

A page component represents a full screen.

Examples:

```txt
StartPage
LoginPage
NotFoundPage
```

A UI component is a small reusable piece used inside pages.

Examples:

```txt
Button
Input
Card
Loading
ErrorMessage
```

Simple rule:

```txt
Page component = screen
UI component = reusable building block
```

#### Key Concept: Props

Props are values passed into a React component.

Example:

```jsx
<Button variant="secondary">Cancel</Button>
```

Here:

```txt
variant is a prop
secondary is the prop value
Cancel is passed as children
```

Props allow one component to behave slightly differently in different places.

#### Key Concept: Children Prop

The `children` prop means the content placed between opening and closing component tags.

Example:

```jsx
<Card>
  <h1>HelloStay</h1>
  <p>Offline hotel management system</p>
</Card>
```

The `Card` component receives everything inside it as `children`.

This makes wrapper components flexible.

#### Key Concept: className

In normal HTML, we use:

```html
<div class="card"></div>
```

In React JSX, we use:

```jsx
<div className="card"></div>
```

React uses `className` because `class` is a reserved word in JavaScript.

#### Files Created

#### `frontend/src/components/ui/Button.jsx`

Purpose:

Creates a reusable button component.

Supports:

- `children`
- `variant`
- `type`
- `disabled`
- `className`
- extra props such as `onClick`

Common usage:

```jsx
<Button>Continue</Button>
<Button variant="secondary">Cancel</Button>
<Button variant="ghost">Back</Button>
```

#### `frontend/src/components/ui/Input.jsx`

Purpose:

Creates a reusable input component.

Supports:

- `label`
- `error`
- `helperText`
- `id`
- `className`
- normal input props such as `type`, `placeholder`, and `value`

Common usage:

```jsx
<Input
  id="username"
  label="Username"
  type="text"
  placeholder="Enter username"
/>
```

#### `frontend/src/components/ui/Card.jsx`

Purpose:

Creates a reusable surface/container component.

Common usage:

```jsx
<Card>
  <h1>HelloStay</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the app.</p>
</Card>
```

#### `frontend/src/components/ui/Loading.jsx`

Purpose:

Creates a reusable loading message component.

Common usage:

```jsx
<Loading message="Loading rooms..." />
```

#### `frontend/src/components/ui/ErrorMessage.jsx`

Purpose:

Creates a reusable error message component.

Common usage:

```jsx
<ErrorMessage message="Something went wrong." />
```

#### Files Modified

#### `frontend/src/styles/global.css`

Purpose:

Stores the global visual foundation.

Includes:

- CSS variables
- global reset
- body styles
- page helper classes
- reusable UI classes

Important sections:

```txt
:root design tokens
base reset
page layout helpers
UI component classes
```

#### `frontend/src/pages/StartPage.jsx`

Purpose:

Uses `Card` and `Button` to make the start page visually consistent.

Still only navigates to the login page.

No backend logic added.

#### `frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx`

Purpose:

Uses `Card`, `Input`, and `Button` to show a placeholder login screen.

Important note:

The login form is not functional yet.

No authentication is added in Milestone 4.

#### `frontend/src/pages/NotFoundPage.jsx`

Purpose:

Uses `Card`, `Button`, and `ErrorMessage` to display a consistent 404 page.

#### Important Architecture Boundary

Milestone 4 belongs only to the React renderer process.

React renderer handles:

```txt
pages
components
forms
styling
routing UI
placeholder layout
```

Electron main process handles:

```txt
desktop window
app lifecycle
native shell behavior
```

Electron preload handles:

```txt
safe communication between renderer and main process when needed
```

FastAPI backend handles:

```txt
business logic
validation
database operations
API contracts
authentication rules
```

No Electron files should be changed in this milestone.

No FastAPI files should be changed in this milestone.

#### Why Dashboard Layout Was Not Built

Dashboard layout is intentionally delayed.

A real dashboard shell usually needs:

- authenticated user state
- protected routes
- sidebar navigation
- topbar
- logout behavior
- active route highlighting
- feature sections

Since real authentication and protected routes are not built yet, building the dashboard shell now would create premature structure.

Milestone 4 only builds generic UI pieces that can support the dashboard later.

#### Why Tailwind or UI Libraries Were Not Added

Tailwind, Material UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design, and similar tools are not used in this milestone.

Reason:

The project goal is to learn frontend architecture from first principles.

Plain CSS helps teach:

- CSS variables
- reusable class names
- layout basics
- component styling
- separation of concerns
- design token thinking

External libraries can be useful later, but they are unnecessary for this foundation milestone.

#### Verification Steps

After implementing Milestone 4:

Run the React development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```txt
http://localhost:5173
```

Verify:

- Start page loads.
- Start page uses the new card/button styling.
- Clicking the login navigation opens the login page.
- Login page shows placeholder inputs.
- Login button remains disabled.
- Back navigation works.
- Unknown routes show the not found page.
- No console import errors appear.
- No CSS import errors appear.

If using Electron development command, verify:

```bash
npm run desktop
```

Expected result:

- Electron opens the React app.
- The same styled pages appear inside the desktop window.
- No Electron main/preload changes are required.

#### Common Errors and Fixes

##### Error: Failed to resolve import

Cause:

The file path is wrong or the file does not exist.

Example:

```txt
Failed to resolve import "../components/ui/Button.jsx"
```

Fix:

From a page file inside:

```txt
src/pages/
```

the correct import path is:

```jsx
import Button from "../components/ui/Button.jsx";
```

##### Error: Styles are not applied

Cause:

`global.css` may not be imported in `main.jsx`.

Fix:

Make sure this exists in:

```txt
frontend/src/main.jsx
```

```jsx
import "./styles/global.css";
```

##### Error: Login button does nothing

Cause:

The login button is intentionally disabled.

Milestone 4 does not implement authentication.

##### Error: Page navigation does not work

Cause:

The `Link` route path may not match `AppRoutes.jsx`.

Fix:

Check that `/login` exists in `AppRoutes.jsx`.

#### Beginner Lessons Learned

Milestone 4 teaches:

- How a small design system begins.
- How CSS variables reduce duplication.
- How reusable components make pages cleaner.
- How props customize components.
- How `children` makes wrapper components flexible.
- How `className` connects JSX to CSS.
- Why UI belongs in React, not Electron main.
- Why building features too early creates confusion.
- Why production apps grow through small stable foundations.

#### Production Lessons Learned

A production frontend should not grow randomly.

Before creating many feature screens, it needs:

- consistent styling rules
- reusable primitives
- clear folder structure
- predictable component APIs
- clean architecture boundaries

Milestone 4 establishes those basics.

#### Final Milestone 4 Result

At the end of this milestone, HelloStay has:

```txt
A cleaner global CSS foundation
A small design token system
Reusable UI components
Improved placeholder pages
Clear renderer-only UI responsibility
No premature hotel features
No premature dashboard shell
No backend integration
No Electron responsibility leakage
```

#### Suggested Next Milestone

The next milestone should likely focus on one of these:

```txt
Milestone 5 — Authentication UI Foundation
```

or

```txt
Milestone 5 — Login Page Form State and Validation Without Backend
```

Recommended next step:

Build the login page properly as a frontend-only form first.

That would teach:

- controlled inputs
- React state
- form submission
- validation
- error display
- disabled submit behavior
- loading state simulation
- preparing for future backend authentication

```

```

### Frontend Milestone 5 Notes: API Client and Backend Communication

**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 5
**Status:** Completed
**Date Completed:** 2026-06-30

#### Goal

The goal of Milestone 5 was to introduce a clean, reusable frontend API communication layer between the React renderer and the FastAPI backend.

This milestone focused only on infrastructure.

It did not build hotel features, authentication, protected routes, dashboard layout, or Electron backend startup behavior.

#### What Was Completed

A new services folder was introduced:

```txt
frontend/src/services/
```

The following files were created:

```txt
frontend/src/services/apiClient.js
frontend/src/services/systemService.js
```

A frontend environment file was introduced:

```txt
frontend/.env.development
```

with the development backend URL:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

The backend connection was tested successfully from the React app.

Both backend responses were received successfully:

```txt
Health data from /
System info from /system-info
```

The backend root health endpoint confirms that the backend server is running, and the backend already allows the React development origin through CORS.

The `/system-info` endpoint was also used safely because it only returns basic application information from the `system_info` table.

#### Files Added

#### `frontend/src/services/apiClient.js`

Purpose:

```txt
Central reusable HTTP client for the React frontend.
```

Responsibilities:

```txt
read API base URL
build request URLs
send HTTP requests using fetch
set common headers
convert request bodies to JSON
parse response bodies safely
handle empty responses
handle network errors
handle backend error responses
prepare for future auth token attachment
```

#### `frontend/src/services/systemService.js`

Purpose:

```txt
Small safe service for backend communication testing.
```

Functions added:

```txt
getBackendHealth()
getSystemInfo()
```

This service was intentionally limited to system-level endpoints.

No feature services were created yet.

#### Temporary File Change

#### `frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx`

A temporary backend connection test was added to the login page.

The test used:

```txt
useState
async/await
try/catch/finally
Loading component
ErrorMessage component
systemService.js
apiClient.js
```

The temporary UI confirmed the backend connection worked.

After successful verification, the temporary test UI should be removed from the login page because it is not production user-facing UI.

#### Important Concepts Learned

#### API Client

An API client is a reusable frontend utility that manages communication with the backend.

Instead of writing raw `fetch()` calls inside every component, components call service functions.

Correct pattern:

```txt
Component
  ↓
Service
  ↓
API client
  ↓
Backend
```

Incorrect pattern:

```txt
Component directly calls fetch everywhere
```

#### Services

Service files describe backend capabilities in frontend-friendly function names.

Example:

```js
getBackendHealth();
```

is clearer than writing:

```js
apiClient.get("/");
```

directly inside many components.

#### HTTP Methods

The basic HTTP methods were introduced:

```txt
GET     read data
POST    create data
PUT     update data
DELETE  remove data
```

Milestone 5 only tested safe `GET` requests.

#### Request and Response

A request is what the frontend sends to the backend.

A response is what the backend sends back.

The frontend must handle:

```txt
response status
response headers
response body
JSON data
error messages
```

#### Status Codes

Important status codes discussed:

```txt
200 success
201 created
204 success with no body
400 bad request
401 unauthenticated
403 forbidden
404 not found
422 FastAPI validation error
500 backend error
```

#### JSON

JSON is the data format used between React and FastAPI.

The API client safely parses JSON instead of assuming every response body is valid JSON.

#### Promises

A Promise represents a value that may be available later.

`fetch()` returns a Promise because network requests are asynchronous.

#### async/await

`async/await` allows asynchronous code to be written in a readable way.

It was used when calling backend service functions.

#### try/catch/finally

`try/catch/finally` was used to manage:

```txt
successful API response
failed API response
loading state cleanup
```

#### Network Error vs Backend Error

Network error:

```txt
React cannot reach FastAPI.
```

Backend error:

```txt
React reached FastAPI, but FastAPI returned an error status.
```

The API client now has a foundation for handling both.

#### Electron Boundary

No API service logic was placed in Electron.

Accepted boundary:

```txt
Electron main process:
  desktop window, lifecycle, shell behavior

React renderer:
  UI and frontend API communication

FastAPI:
  business logic, validation, database, API contracts
```

This keeps Electron from becoming a hidden backend or business-logic layer.

#### Backend Boundary

FastAPI remains the source of truth.

React does not validate hotel business rules independently.

React will later consume backend contracts for:

```txt
authentication
rooms
guests
stays
guest-stays
bookings
finance
history
```

The backend already contains routers for rooms, guests, stays, guest-stays, and system info, but Milestone 5 intentionally used only safe system-level communication.

#### What Was Intentionally Not Done

The following were not implemented:

```txt
real login
register account
auth token storage
protected routes
dashboard
sidebar layout
room management UI
guest management UI
stay management UI
booking workflows
finance screen
history screen
settings screen
Electron backend startup
packaging
```

This protected the milestone boundary.

#### Verification Steps Completed

The following checks passed:

```txt
React app runs successfully
FastAPI backend runs successfully
React can call backend /
React can call backend /system-info
API response appears in temporary UI
network communication works through service layer
apiClient.js handles the request
systemService.js exposes safe test functions
```

#### Cleanup Step

After successful verification, remove the temporary backend test UI from `LoginPage.jsx`.

Keep:

```txt
frontend/.env.development
frontend/src/services/apiClient.js
frontend/src/services/systemService.js
```

Remove only the temporary test UI code from the page.

#### Final Milestone Result

Milestone 5 successfully established the frontend API communication foundation.

HelloStay now has a clean service layer that future milestones can build on.

Future frontend features should not directly call `fetch()` inside page components. They should use domain service files that depend on `apiClient.js`.

#### Suggested Next Milestone

The next milestone should be:

```txt
Frontend Milestone 6 — Authentication UI Structure
```

Recommended scope:

```txt
create login form state
create create-account form UI
prepare authService.js
understand backend auth contract
do not build protected dashboard yet unless authentication is working
```

Authentication should be handled as a separate milestone because it introduces forms, validation, token handling, user state, and route protection.

---

### Frontend Milestone 6 Notes: Authentication UI Foundation

**Status:** Completed
**Date Completed:** 2026-06-30
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 6 — Authentication UI Foundation

#### Goal

The goal of Milestone 6 was to create the authentication UI foundation for HelloStay without implementing fake authentication or assuming backend endpoint contracts that are not yet confirmed.

This milestone focused on frontend form structure, React state, validation, loading states, error handling, routing, and service-layer preparation.

#### Completed Work

Milestone 6 completed the following:

- Converted `LoginPage.jsx` from a placeholder screen into a real login form UI.
- Created `RegisterPage.jsx` for the V1 account creation direction.
- Added a `/register` route in `AppRoutes.jsx`.
- Used existing shared UI components such as:
  - `Button`
  - `Input`
  - `Card`
  - `Loading`
  - `ErrorMessage`

- Used controlled components for form fields.
- Used React `useState` for form values.
- Added field-level validation.
- Added form-level error state.
- Added loading/submitting state.
- Disabled form controls while submitting.
- Added `authService.js` as the dedicated authentication service layer.
- Prepared login/register service functions for future backend integration.
- Avoided direct API calls inside page components.
- Avoided fake authentication.
- Avoided hardcoded users.
- Avoided dashboard redirect.
- Avoided token persistence.
- Avoided protected routes.
- Kept Electron separate from authentication form logic.

#### Files Added

```text
frontend/src/services/authService.js
frontend/src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx
```

#### Files Updated

```text
frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx
frontend/src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx
frontend/src/styles/global.css
```

Depending on the existing reusable UI component implementation, these may also have been checked or adjusted:

```text
frontend/src/components/ui/Input.jsx
frontend/src/components/ui/Button.jsx
```

#### Authentication Flow Reviewed

The expected future authentication flow for HelloStay V1 is:

```text
StartPage
   |
   v
LoginPage
   |
   v
authService.login()
   |
   v
apiClient
   |
   v
FastAPI auth endpoint
   |
   v
Backend verifies credentials
   |
   v
Backend returns JWT token
   |
   v
Frontend updates auth state
   |
   v
Protected dashboard access
```

Milestone 6 implemented only the frontend foundation up to the service boundary.

#### Important Backend Finding

The backend currently contains JWT/password helper functionality and token schemas, but the available FastAPI app setup does not show a registered authentication router.

This means the frontend should not yet assume endpoint paths such as:

```text
/auth/login
/auth/register
/auth/me
/logout
```

These must be confirmed or created in the backend before real frontend authentication is implemented.

#### Key Concepts Learned

#### Authentication

Authentication answers:

```text
Who is this user?
```

In HelloStay, this means verifying a username and password before allowing access to hotel management features.

#### Authorization

Authorization answers:

```text
What is this authenticated user allowed to do?
```

Authorization is not part of Milestone 6. It will matter later when roles and permissions are introduced.

#### Controlled Components

The form inputs are controlled by React state.

This means the input value is stored in React, and the UI updates whenever the state changes.

Example concept:

```text
Input value changes
   |
   v
onChange runs
   |
   v
React state updates
   |
   v
Component re-renders
   |
   v
Input displays new value
```

#### useState

`useState` was used to remember:

- Form field values.
- Field validation errors.
- General form error.
- Loading/submitting state.

#### preventDefault

`event.preventDefault()` was used to stop the browser from refreshing the page during form submission.

This is necessary because HelloStay is a React single-page application inside an Electron desktop shell.

#### Loading State

Loading state was added so the UI can show when the app is attempting an authentication action.

Even though real auth is not connected yet, this prepares the UI for real API calls.

#### Error State

Error state was added so users can see useful feedback when validation fails or when auth endpoints are not confirmed.

#### Service Layer

`authService.js` was created so authentication-related API behavior does not live directly inside page components.

This keeps the architecture cleaner and prepares the project for future backend integration.

#### What Was Intentionally Not Added

The following were intentionally not added in Milestone 6:

- Real login API integration.
- Real register API integration.
- Fake users.
- Fake successful login.
- Dashboard redirect.
- AuthContext.
- ProtectedRoute.
- Token storage.
- Logout.
- Current user restore.
- Role-based authorization.
- Dashboard layout.
- Rooms, guests, stays, bookings, finance, or history screens.
- Electron backend startup.
- Electron packaging.

#### Why These Were Not Added

These features depend on a confirmed authentication contract from the backend.

Before adding them, the project needs to know:

- Which endpoint handles login.
- Which endpoint handles registration.
- What request body each endpoint expects.
- What response body each endpoint returns.
- Whether JWT is returned.
- How the current user is fetched.
- How logout should behave.
- How token storage should work in an offline Electron app.

Adding protected routes or token persistence before answering these questions would create unstable architecture.

#### Verification Checklist

Milestone 6 is considered complete if the following are true:

```text
/login opens correctly.
/register opens correctly.
Login fields are typeable.
Register fields are typeable.
Empty login form shows validation errors.
Empty register form shows validation errors.
Password mismatch shows an error on register.
Submit button disables while submitting.
Loading UI appears during submit.
Valid login submit does not fake success.
Valid register submit does not fake account creation.
No dashboard redirect happens.
No token is stored.
No ProtectedRoute exists.
No AuthContext exists yet.
No auth endpoint path is invented.
```

#### Current Application State After Milestone 6

The frontend now has:

```text
StartPage
LoginPage
RegisterPage
NotFoundPage
Reusable UI components
apiClient.js
authService.js
Basic routing
Authentication UI foundation
```

The frontend still does not have:

```text
Real authentication
Global auth state
Protected routes
Dashboard
Hotel modules
Electron backend startup
Packaging
```

#### Architecture Boundary Preserved

Milestone 6 preserved the correct responsibility split:

```text
React:
Forms, UI state, validation display, user interaction.

authService.js:
Authentication service boundary.

apiClient.js:
Generic backend communication behavior.

FastAPI:
Credential verification, password hashing, JWT creation, database access, API contracts.

Electron:
Desktop shell only, not authentication logic.
```

#### Milestone 6 Result

Milestone 6 successfully prepared HelloStay for real authentication without violating the source-of-truth rule.

The frontend now looks and behaves like it is ready for authentication, but it correctly waits for backend contract confirmation before real login/register behavior is added.

#### Recommended Next Milestone

The next milestone should be:

```text
Frontend Milestone 7 — Authentication Contract and Auth State Foundation
```

Milestone 7 should focus on:

- Verifying or defining the backend auth API contract.
- Deciding the login request shape.
- Deciding the login response shape.
- Planning token handling.
- Planning current user restore.
- Planning AuthContext.
- Planning ProtectedRoute.
- Preparing redirect-after-login behavior.
- Still avoiding dashboard feature development until the auth foundation is stable.

---

### Frontend Milestone 7 Notes: Auth State and Protected Routes

**Status:** Completed with backend-auth limitation documented
**Date Completed:** 2026-07-01
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 7 — Auth State and Protected Routes

#### Objective

The objective of this milestone was to introduce global authentication state and protected frontend routing in HelloStay without building the real dashboard or hotel modules.

The milestone focused on preparing the frontend authentication foundation while respecting the rule that FastAPI remains the source of truth for real authentication, validation, token creation, and API security.

#### What Was Built

The following authentication foundation was added or prepared:

```txt
AuthContext.jsx
ProtectedRoute.jsx
DashboardPlaceholderPage.jsx
AuthProvider wrapping
LoginPage connection to AuthContext
Temporary protected /dashboard route
Logout behavior structure
Safe authService.js placeholder
```

#### Files Added or Updated

```txt
frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx
frontend/src/routes/ProtectedRoute.jsx
frontend/src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx
frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx
frontend/src/pages/DashboardPlaceholderPage.jsx
frontend/src/services/authService.js
frontend/src/main.jsx
```

#### Main Concepts Learned

This milestone introduced the following React and frontend architecture concepts:

```txt
Global state
React Context
Context Provider
useContext
Custom hooks
AuthProvider
Protected routes
Navigate from React Router
Redirect behavior
Session/token storage strategy
Authentication vs authorization
Frontend guards vs backend security
```

#### AuthContext Responsibility

`AuthContext.jsx` became the central place for frontend authentication state.

It is responsible for:

```txt
tracking the current token
checking whether the user is authenticated
exposing login()
exposing logout()
storing temporary frontend session/token data
clearing token data on logout
providing auth state to the rest of the app
```

This keeps authentication state out of individual page components.

#### ProtectedRoute Responsibility

`ProtectedRoute.jsx` protects private frontend routes.

Its responsibility is simple:

```txt
If user is authenticated:
  render the protected page

If user is not authenticated:
  redirect to /login
```

This milestone verified that unauthenticated access to `/dashboard` correctly redirects to `/login`.

#### Temporary Dashboard Placeholder

A temporary `DashboardPlaceholderPage.jsx` was created only for route protection testing.

This page is not the real dashboard.

It exists only to verify:

```txt
private route access
auth context availability
logout behavior structure
redirect behavior
```

The real dashboard shell, sidebar, navigation, and hotel modules will be built in later milestones.

#### LoginPage Behavior

`LoginPage.jsx` was connected to the auth context structure.

The page now has responsibility for:

```txt
controlled username/password form state
basic frontend validation
calling login() from AuthContext
showing loading state
showing error state
redirecting authenticated users away from login
```

However, real login success is not yet fully testable because the confirmed backend authentication endpoint is not currently available.

#### Backend Auth Limitation

The current backend has authentication foundations such as password hashing, password verification, JWT creation, and token schemas.

However, based on the currently available backend files, `main.py` does not register an authentication router or expose a confirmed login endpoint.

Because of this, the frontend does not fake login success and does not invent endpoint contracts.

#### Verified Output

The following behavior was verified successfully:

```txt
Visiting /dashboard while unauthenticated redirects to /login.
The protected route guard works.
AuthProvider is correctly wrapping the app.
useAuth is available inside protected routing flow.
No fake token is created.
No fake production login is implemented.
```

#### Not Yet Verified

The following behavior is intentionally not marked complete yet:

```txt
successful backend login
real token returned from FastAPI
authenticated access to /dashboard after login
logout after real authenticated login
token validation on app startup
role-based permission handling
```

These require a confirmed backend authentication endpoint.

#### Important Rules Followed

This milestone followed these project rules:

```txt
No full dashboard layout was built.
No sidebar navigation was built.
No rooms module was built.
No guests module was built.
No stays/bookings module was built.
No finance/history module was built.
No settings module was built.
No Electron backend startup was added.
No packaging was added.
No auth logic was placed randomly inside page components.
No backend business logic was moved into React or Electron.
No hotel business data was stored in localStorage/sessionStorage.
No fake production authentication was created.
```

#### Token Storage Decision

For V1 frontend session state, temporary token storage may use `sessionStorage`.

Reason:

```txt
It is simple.
It survives page refresh during the current session.
It clears when the session/window closes.
It avoids longer-term persistence compared to localStorage.
```

This is a simple V1 decision and can be revisited later when Electron packaging and more secure desktop storage are introduced.

#### Authentication vs Authorization

This milestone handled authentication foundation only.

Authentication answers:

```txt
Who is the user?
```

Authorization answers:

```txt
What is the user allowed to do?
```

Role-based permissions are intentionally postponed to a future milestone.

#### Frontend Guard vs Backend Security

A protected frontend route is useful, but it is not real backend security.

Frontend protected routes:

```txt
control UI navigation
improve user experience
prevent normal unauthenticated access through the interface
```

Backend security:

```txt
protects actual hotel data
validates tokens
rejects unauthorized API requests
prevents direct API misuse
```

FastAPI must still protect private APIs when authentication endpoints are completed.

#### Electron Responsibility Reminder

Electron main process does not manage login form state, token state, route access, or hotel business logic.

Correct responsibility split:

```txt
React renderer:
- auth UI
- auth state
- protected routes
- redirects

FastAPI:
- credential validation
- JWT creation
- database access
- API protection

Electron main:
- desktop shell
- app lifecycle
- native window
- startup flow
```

#### Milestone Result

Milestone 7 successfully created the frontend authentication-state foundation and verified unauthenticated protected route behavior.

The milestone is complete from the frontend-structure perspective, with real login integration blocked until the backend exposes and registers a confirmed authentication endpoint.

#### Suggested Next Step

The next milestone should not build rooms, guests, bookings, or finance yet if backend authentication is still incomplete.

Recommended next step:

```txt
Milestone 8 — Backend Auth Contract Review / Frontend Auth Integration Preparation
```

This milestone should confirm or create the real backend authentication API contract before the frontend attempts real login integration.

---

### Milestone 8 Notes: Dashboard Layout and Navigation

**Goal:**
Milestone 8 introduced the main protected dashboard structure for HelloStay.

The purpose was to replace the temporary protected placeholder page with a real dashboard shell.

The milestone focused on:

```txt
Dashboard layout
Sidebar navigation
Top header
Nested dashboard routes
Protected dashboard access
Placeholder pages for future modules
Logout behavior
```

**Completed Work:**
A new dashboard layout was created:

```txt
src/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx
```

This layout contains:

```txt
Sidebar navigation
Top header
Main content area
Logout button
Outlet for nested route rendering
```

The layout is desktop-first because HelloStay is an Electron desktop application.

**Dashboard Pages Created:**
The following placeholder pages were created:

```txt
src/pages/DashboardHome.jsx
src/pages/RoomsPage.jsx
src/pages/GuestsPage.jsx
src/pages/StaysPage.jsx
src/pages/FinancePage.jsx
src/pages/HistoryPage.jsx
```

These pages are placeholders only.

They do not contain:

```txt
API calls
Tables
Forms
Modals
Charts
CRUD logic
Search
Filters
Business workflows
```

**Route Updates:**
`AppRoutes.jsx` was updated to support protected nested dashboard routes.

Final route direction:

```txt
/                   → StartPage
/login              → LoginPage
/register           → RegisterPage
/dashboard          → DashboardLayout + DashboardHome
/dashboard/rooms    → DashboardLayout + RoomsPage
/dashboard/guests   → DashboardLayout + GuestsPage
/dashboard/stays    → DashboardLayout + StaysPage
/dashboard/finance  → DashboardLayout + FinancePage
/dashboard/history  → DashboardLayout + HistoryPage
*                   → NotFoundPage
```

The dashboard parent route is protected by `ProtectedRoute`.

This means all child routes under `/dashboard` are protected automatically.

**React Router Concepts Learned:**
Nested routes were introduced.

A parent route can render a layout, and child routes can render inside that layout.

The `Outlet` component marks where child route content appears.

Example:

```txt
DashboardLayout
└── Outlet
    └── Current child page
```

When the URL is `/dashboard/rooms`, the layout remains visible and only the main content changes to `RoomsPage`.

**NavLink Concept Learned:**
The sidebar uses `NavLink`.

`NavLink` was used because it can detect the active route.

Difference:

```txt
Link     → navigates only
NavLink  → navigates and supports active styling
```

The dashboard home link uses `end: true` so it is active only on `/dashboard`.

Without `end: true`, the dashboard link could remain active on child routes like `/dashboard/rooms`.

**Layout Concept Learned:**
A dashboard layout is an application shell.

An application shell is the stable outer frame of the app.

For HelloStay, the shell contains:

```txt
Sidebar
Header
Main content area
```

The benefit is that the sidebar and header are written once and reused across all dashboard pages.

Without a layout, each page would need to duplicate sidebar and header code.

**Files Added:**

```txt
src/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx

src/pages/DashboardHome.jsx
src/pages/RoomsPage.jsx
src/pages/GuestsPage.jsx
src/pages/StaysPage.jsx
src/pages/FinancePage.jsx
src/pages/HistoryPage.jsx

src/context/AuthContext.js
src/context/AuthProvider.jsx
src/hooks/useAuth.js
```

**Files Updated:**

```txt
src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx
src/pages/LoginPage.jsx
src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx
src/services/authService.js
src/styles/global.css
src/App.jsx
src/main.jsx
src/routes/ProtectedRoute.jsx
```

**Files Removed from Active Use:**

```txt
src/pages/DashboardPlaceholderPage.jsx
src/context/AuthContext.jsx
```

**Auth Refactor Notes:**
The old auth file caused a React Fast Refresh warning because it exported a context object, a provider component, and a custom hook from the same file.

Old structure:

```txt
AuthContext.jsx
├── AuthContext
├── AuthProvider
└── useAuth
```

New structure:

```txt
AuthContext.js
└── AuthContext only

AuthProvider.jsx
└── AuthProvider only

useAuth.js
└── useAuth only
```

This fixed the Fast Refresh warning and made the auth code easier to maintain.

**Temporary Auth Mock Notes:**
Backend authentication is not implemented yet.

Because of that, real login and registration cannot be tested against FastAPI yet.

Temporary frontend-only mocks were added in:

```txt
src/services/authService.js
```

Temporary login returns a fake token:

```txt
dev-token-...
```

Temporary registration allows the register page UI to load and submit without crashing.

These mocks are only for frontend development.

They must be removed when backend login/register endpoints are implemented.

**Bug Fixed: Dashboard Redirected to Login:**
Problem:

```txt
/dashboard always redirected to /login
```

Cause:

```txt
ProtectedRoute saw isAuthenticated as false because no backend login token was available.
```

Fix:

```txt
Temporary frontend login mock was added so AuthProvider could receive an access_token and set isAuthenticated to true.
```

**Bug Fixed: Fast Refresh AuthContext Error:**
Problem:

```txt
Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components.
```

Cause:

```txt
AuthContext.jsx exported AuthContext, AuthProvider, and useAuth together.
```

Fix:

```txt
AuthContext.js
AuthProvider.jsx
useAuth.js
```

were created and imports were updated.

**Bug Fixed: Missing AuthContext Import:**
Problem:

```txt
Vite could not resolve ./AuthContext.js from AuthProvider.jsx.
```

Cause:

```txt
AuthContext.js was expected by imports but was missing or not correctly created.
```

Fix:

```txt
src/context/AuthContext.js
```

was created with only the React context export.

**Bug Fixed: Old AuthContext Import:**
Problem:

```txt
The old AuthContext.jsx error still appeared.
```

Cause:

```txt
main.jsx still imported the old AuthContext.jsx file.
```

Fix:

```txt
main.jsx was cleaned so it only renders App.
App.jsx became responsible for wrapping AppRoutes with AuthProvider.
```

**Bug Fixed: Register Page Not Found:**
Problem:

```txt
Clicking Create new account showed NotFoundPage.
```

Cause:

```txt
The RegisterPage existed but /register was not correctly registered in AppRoutes.jsx.
```

Fix:

```txt
RegisterPage was imported into AppRoutes.jsx.
The /register route was added.
The login page link was matched to /register.
```

**Bug Fixed: White Screen:**
Problem:

```txt
Opening the frontend showed a white screen.
```

Cause:

```txt
RegisterPage.jsx imported registerAccount, but authService.js did not export registerAccount.
```

Fix:

```txt
registerAccount was added to authService.js as a temporary development mock.
```

Lesson learned:

```txt
A white screen usually means React crashed.
The browser console usually shows the real reason.
```

**Verification Completed:**
The following behaviors were verified:

```txt
Frontend opens at http://localhost:5173
StartPage loads
LoginPage loads
RegisterPage loads
Temporary login works
sessionStorage stores hellostay_access_token
ProtectedRoute allows dashboard after login
/dashboard opens DashboardLayout
Sidebar appears
Top header appears
DashboardHome placeholder appears
Rooms placeholder opens
Guests placeholder opens
Stays placeholder opens
Finance placeholder opens
History placeholder opens
Active sidebar link styling works
Logout clears token
/dashboard redirects to /login after logout
```

**What Was Not Added:**
Milestone 8 intentionally did not add:

```txt
Real backend authentication
Backend startup from Electron
Dashboard metrics
Charts
Rooms CRUD
Guests CRUD
Stays or bookings workflow
Finance logic
History logic
Role-based permissions
Settings
Packaging
Production auth persistence
```

**Current Final Frontend Direction:**
The frontend now has a protected dashboard foundation.

Future module pages can be added inside the dashboard layout without changing the core shell.

Current structure:

```txt
DashboardLayout
└── Outlet
    └── Feature module page
```

**Suggested Next Step:**
The next milestone should be:

```txt
Milestone 9 — Rooms Module Read-Only Foundation
```

Recommended focus:

```txt
Create room service functions
Connect to the existing backend /rooms endpoint
Display a simple read-only rooms list
Add loading state
Add error state
Do not add create/edit/delete yet
```

### Milestone 9 Notes — Rooms Module Read-Only Foundation

**Status:** Completed
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 9
**Project:** HelloStay — Offline Hotel Management System
**Date Recorded:** 2026-07-02

#### Purpose

Milestone 9 introduced the first real backend-connected hotel module in the HelloStay frontend: the Rooms module read-only foundation.

The goal of this milestone was to connect the existing React frontend to the FastAPI backend `GET /rooms` endpoint and display room records in the dashboard without adding create, edit, delete, forms, modals, filters, pagination, or booking-related availability logic.

This milestone marks the transition from placeholder dashboard pages to real API-driven frontend behavior.

#### What Was Built

The Rooms page was updated from a placeholder page into a real read-only data page.

The frontend now:

- Uses the existing shared API client.
- Adds a room-specific service file.
- Calls the backend `GET /rooms` endpoint.
- Fetches rooms when the Rooms page loads.
- Stores room data in React state.
- Shows a loading state while the request is running.
- Shows an error state if the backend request fails.
- Shows an empty state if no rooms exist.
- Shows a read-only room list/card layout when rooms are available.

#### Files Added

```txt
frontend/src/services/roomService.js
```

#### Files Updated

```txt
frontend/src/pages/RoomsPage.jsx
frontend/src/styles/global.css
```

#### Main Implementation Details

A new `roomService.js` file was created inside the `services` folder.

The service exposes a `getRooms` function that calls:

```txt
GET /rooms
```

through the existing `apiRequest` helper from `apiClient.js`.

The `RoomsPage.jsx` file was updated to use:

```js
useState;
useEffect;
getRooms;
```

The page manages three main pieces of state:

```js
rooms;
isLoading;
error;
```

The page now handles four important UI states:

```txt
Loading state
Error state
Empty state
Success state
```

#### Data Flow

```txt
RoomsPage.jsx
  ↓ calls
getRooms()
  ↓ calls
apiRequest("/rooms")
  ↓ sends request to
FastAPI GET /rooms
  ↓ returns
Room records from SQLite database
  ↓ displayed in
RoomsPage.jsx
```

#### Backend Endpoint Used

```txt
GET /rooms
```

Expected room fields:

```txt
id
room_number
price_per_night
room_status
room_type
max_occupancy
facilities
```

#### What Was Intentionally Not Added

The following were intentionally not added in this milestone:

```txt
Create room
Edit room
Delete room
Room forms
Room modals
Inline room status update
Room image support
Pagination
Sorting
Advanced filters
Booking-based availability
Guest logic
Stay logic
Finance logic
History logic
Electron backend startup
Packaging
```

#### React Concepts Practiced

This milestone introduced and practiced important React concepts:

```txt
Component state with useState
Side effects with useEffect
Async data fetching
Conditional rendering
Loading UI
Error UI
Empty UI
Success UI
Rendering lists with map()
Using keys in lists
Separating API logic from UI logic
```

#### JavaScript Concepts Practiced

This milestone also reinforced JavaScript concepts:

```txt
ES module imports and exports
Async functions
await
try/catch/finally
Arrays
Array.isArray()
Conditional checks
Nullish coalescing
Template-friendly data rendering
```

#### Architecture Lessons

The key architecture lesson was that UI pages should not directly know all backend request details.

Instead:

```txt
RoomsPage.jsx handles UI.
roomService.js handles room-related API functions.
apiClient.js handles common HTTP request behavior.
FastAPI handles business logic, validation, and database access.
Electron remains only the desktop shell.
```

This keeps the application clean, testable, and easier to maintain.

#### Verification Completed

The milestone is considered complete because:

- The room service file was created.
- The `getRooms` function calls the existing API client.
- `RoomsPage.jsx` fetches room data on page load.
- Loading state appears while data is being fetched.
- Error state appears when the backend request fails.
- Empty state appears when no rooms exist.
- Room records display successfully when backend data exists.
- No CRUD functionality was added.
- Electron files were not modified.
- Backend business logic remained inside FastAPI.

#### Final Outcome

Milestone 9 successfully established the read-only foundation for the Rooms module.

HelloStay now has its first real dashboard module connected to the backend through the frontend service layer.

This creates a safe foundation for future room workflows such as creating, editing, deleting, and managing room availability.

### Frontend Milestone 10 — Rooms Module Create Foundation

**Status:** Completed
**Date Completed:** 2026-07-03
**Related AD:** Frontend AD 10 — Rooms Module Create Foundation Through Service Layer

**Goal:**
Add the ability to create new room records from the Rooms page using the existing backend `POST /rooms` endpoint.

**Starting point:**
Milestone 9 had already completed the read-only Rooms foundation:

- `RoomsPage.jsx` displayed rooms from the backend
- `roomService.js` had `getRooms()`
- `GET /rooms` was connected through `apiClient.js`
- loading state was implemented
- error state was implemented
- empty state was implemented
- rooms were displayed in a card-based read-only UI

Milestone 10 continued from that foundation without rebuilding the Rooms page from scratch.

**Completed work:**

- Added `createRoom()` to `roomService.js`
- Connected `createRoom()` to `POST /rooms`
- Kept room API calls inside the service layer
- Added an inline Add New Room form to `RoomsPage.jsx`
- Used existing reusable UI components:
  - `Card`
  - `Button`
  - `Input`
  - `Loading`
  - `ErrorMessage`

- Added controlled form state using `useState`
- Added form input handling with `handleInputChange`
- Added frontend validation with `validateRoomForm`
- Added submit handling with `handleCreateRoom`
- Used `event.preventDefault()` to stop default browser form submission
- Converted input strings into backend-friendly payload values
- Added `isCreating` loading state for room creation
- Added `createError` state for creation errors
- Cleared the form after successful room creation
- Refreshed the rooms list after successful creation
- Verified backend persistence by refreshing the page
- Verified duplicate room-number behavior
- Fixed a React effect warning by avoiding the problematic `loadRooms()` call pattern inside `useEffect`

**Final frontend behavior:**

The Rooms page now supports this flow:

```txt
Open Rooms page
  ↓
Existing rooms load from backend
  ↓
User fills Add New Room form
  ↓
Frontend validates the form
  ↓
User submits the form
  ↓
POST /rooms is sent through roomService
  ↓
Room is created in backend database
  ↓
Form clears
  ↓
Rooms list refreshes
  ↓
New room appears on the page
```

**Form fields added:**

- Room Number
- Room Type
- Price Per Night
- Max Occupancy
- Room Status
- Facilities

**Validation rules added:**

- Room number is required
- Price per night is required
- Price per night must be a valid positive number
- Room status is required
- Max occupancy must be a valid positive whole number if provided

**Important React concepts practiced:**

- controlled components
- `useState`
- `useEffect`
- event handling
- form submission
- `event.preventDefault()`
- conditional rendering
- loading states
- error states
- async/await
- service-layer API calls
- refreshing data after mutation

**Important JavaScript concepts practiced:**

- object state
- object spreading
- computed property names
- string trimming
- number conversion
- async functions
- try/catch/finally
- validation functions
- conditional payload values

**Important frontend architecture concepts practiced:**

- page components should not directly contain raw fetch logic
- service functions make API usage cleaner
- backend remains the source of truth
- frontend validation improves UX but does not replace backend validation
- refetching after create is safer than optimistic updates in early milestones
- Electron should not contain room business logic
- features should be added in small, testable milestones

**Verification completed:**

The following behavior was confirmed:

- Rooms page loads successfully
- Existing rooms are displayed
- Add New Room form appears
- New room can be created successfully
- Form clears after successful creation
- Rooms list refreshes after successful creation
- Created room remains after page refresh
- Duplicate room number produces backend/database uniqueness behavior
- React effect warning was resolved
- No edit/delete/status update behavior was added

**Known backend improvement discovered:**
When a duplicate room number is submitted, the database correctly blocks the duplicate because room numbers are unique. However, the backend currently surfaces this as an internal server error. A future backend polish task should convert this into a clean user-facing error such as:

```txt
Room number already exists.
```

This is not part of Milestone 10 frontend scope but should be tracked for production readiness.

**Files changed:**

```txt
frontend/
  src/
    services/
      roomService.js

    pages/
      RoomsPage.jsx
```

Optional styling may also have been added or adjusted in:

```txt
frontend/
  src/
    styles/
      global.css
```

**What was not included in this milestone:**

- room editing
- room deletion
- room status mutation
- booking integration
- availability calculation
- room images
- pagination
- sorting
- advanced filtering
- modal form
- room-specific component extraction
- Electron backend startup
- packaging
- guest, booking, finance, history, or settings logic

**Completion summary:**
Milestone 10 successfully introduced the first create workflow in the Rooms module. The implementation stayed beginner-friendly and production-oriented by using the existing service layer, controlled form state, basic validation, backend submission, loading/error handling, and post-create refetching.

**Suggested next milestone:**
Milestone 11 should be:

```txt
Milestone 11 — Rooms Module Edit Foundation
```

Recommended focus:

- add `updateRoom()` in `roomService.js`
- connect to `PUT /rooms/{room_id}`
- allow selecting one room for editing
- reuse the existing room form pattern where reasonable
- keep delete separate
- keep room status mutation separate
- keep booking availability separate
- avoid advanced filters and pagination for now

### Frontend Milestone 11 — Rooms Module Edit and Delete Foundation

**Status:** Completed
**Date Completed:** 2026-07-08
**Project:** HelloStay Frontend
**Frontend Area:** Rooms Module
**Related Architecture Decision:** Frontend AD 11

Milestone 11 focused on completing the basic room management foundation by adding edit and delete functionality to the existing Rooms module.

Before this milestone, the Rooms module already supported reading rooms from the backend and creating new rooms. In this milestone, the module was extended so that existing room records can be updated and deleted through the FastAPI backend while keeping React responsible only for UI state, user interaction, and API coordination.

#### Completed Work

The existing `roomService.js` file was extended with two new service functions:

- `updateRoom(roomId, roomData)`
- `deleteRoom(roomId)`

The `updateRoom` function sends room updates to the backend using:

```txt
PUT /rooms/{room_id}
```

The `deleteRoom` function deletes a room through the backend using:

```txt
DELETE /rooms/{room_id}
```

All room-related API calls remain inside the room service layer instead of being written directly inside the page component.

The existing `RoomsPage.jsx` implementation was enhanced to support edit mode. Each room now has an edit action. When the user clicks edit, the selected room’s current values are copied into the form so the user can update them. The same form is reused for both room creation and room editing.

The page now tracks the selected room being edited using edit-related state. This allows the UI to switch between create mode and edit mode clearly.

A cancel edit action was also added so the user can leave edit mode and return the form to its default create-room state.

Delete functionality was added to each room item. Because deletion is a destructive action, an inline confirmation pattern was added before the room is deleted. This keeps the milestone simple and beginner-friendly without introducing modal complexity too early.

Loading and error states were added for update and delete operations. After a successful update or delete, the rooms list is refreshed from the backend so the UI stays synchronized with the database.

#### Files Changed

```txt
frontend/
  src/
    services/
      roomService.js

    pages/
      RoomsPage.jsx

    styles/
      global.css
```

#### Key Concepts Practiced

This milestone reinforced several important React and frontend engineering concepts:

- Service-layer API organization
- Controlled form inputs
- Reusing a form for create and edit workflows
- Pre-filling form state from selected data
- Tracking edit mode with React state
- Canceling edit mode safely
- Handling destructive actions with confirmation
- Managing update and delete loading states
- Managing update and delete error states
- Refreshing server data after mutations
- Keeping FastAPI as the source of truth
- Keeping Electron out of business logic

#### Backend Integration

The frontend now integrates with the existing backend room update and delete routes.

Room update uses:

```txt
PUT /rooms/{room_id}
```

Room delete uses:

```txt
DELETE /rooms/{room_id}
```

The backend remains responsible for validation, database updates, database deletion, and error responses such as room-not-found cases.

React does not directly modify the database. React sends requests to FastAPI through the service layer.

#### UI Behavior Added

The Rooms page now supports the following user flow:

```txt
Load rooms
Create room
Click Edit on an existing room
Pre-fill form with room data
Update room
Refresh rooms list
Cancel edit mode if needed
Click Delete on an existing room
Show inline confirmation
Confirm deletion
Refresh rooms list
```

#### Important Boundaries

This milestone intentionally did not add:

- Booking-based room availability
- Room status automation
- Stays or bookings integration
- Guests module logic
- Finance module logic
- History module logic
- Advanced filtering
- Pagination
- Sorting
- Room images
- Optimistic updates
- Modal system
- Electron backend startup
- Electron room API logic

These features are reserved for future milestones.

#### Verification Completed

Milestone 11 was considered complete after verifying that:

- Rooms still load correctly.
- New rooms can still be created.
- Existing rooms can be selected for editing.
- The edit form is pre-filled correctly.
- Edited room details are saved through the backend.
- The rooms list refreshes after update.
- Edit mode can be canceled.
- Delete confirmation appears before deletion.
- Clicking cancel prevents deletion.
- Confirming delete removes the room through the backend.
- The rooms list refreshes after deletion.
- Errors are shown when update or delete fails.
- The UI remains visually consistent with the HelloStay V1 design direction.

#### Summary

Milestone 11 completed the basic CRUD foundation for the Rooms module.

The Rooms module now supports:

```txt
Create → POST /rooms
Read   → GET /rooms
Update → PUT /rooms/{room_id}
Delete → DELETE /rooms/{room_id}
```

This milestone strengthened the project’s frontend architecture by keeping API communication inside the service layer, keeping form and interaction state inside React, and preserving FastAPI as the source of truth for room data.

The Rooms module is now ready for future UX cleanup, filtering, and later booking/stay integration.

### Frontend Milestone 12 — Rooms Module UX Refinement and Code Cleanup

**Status:** Completed
**Date Completed:** 2026-07-08
**Project:** HelloStay — Offline Hotel Management System
**Frontend Stack:** React, JavaScript, Vite, Electron Renderer
**Backend Stack:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite

Milestone 12 focused on refining the already-working Rooms module after Milestones 9, 10, and 11.

The goal of this milestone was not to add new backend features or start a new module. The goal was to improve the readability, structure, user experience, and visual consistency of the Rooms page while preserving the existing get, create, edit, and delete behavior.

The Rooms module remains connected to the FastAPI backend through the existing room service layer. FastAPI continues to be the source of truth for room data, validation, database operations, and API contracts.

**What was completed:**

- Reviewed the existing `RoomsPage.jsx` after room listing, creation, editing, and deletion had already been implemented.
- Identified that the page had grown large enough to benefit from small, focused component extraction.
- Refactored the Rooms module without rewriting it from scratch.
- Preserved existing backend integration and CRUD behavior.
- Kept room API calls inside `roomService.js`.
- Improved the visual layout of the Rooms page.
- Improved the page heading, spacing, card surfaces, form layout, and room list display.
- Improved the create/edit form experience.
- Made edit mode easier to understand by changing the form heading and showing a cancel edit action.
- Improved success and error message placement.
- Improved validation messages for required room fields.
- Improved delete confirmation behavior and delete loading feedback.
- Ensured errors do not break the entire Rooms page.
- Preserved room list refresh behavior after create, update, and delete operations.
- Kept reusable UI components generic.
- Extracted room-specific components only where they improved readability.

**Files added or refined:**

- `src/pages/RoomsPage.jsx`
- `src/components/rooms/RoomForm.jsx`
- `src/components/rooms/RoomTable.jsx`
- `src/styles/global.css`

**Responsibilities after this milestone:**

`RoomsPage.jsx` is responsible for page-level behavior, including room state, form state, loading state, error state, success messages, create/edit mode, and calls to `roomService.js`.

`RoomForm.jsx` is responsible for rendering the create/edit room form. It receives form data, validation errors, mode, submit state, and event handlers through props.

`RoomTable.jsx` is responsible for rendering the room list in a clean desktop-friendly table format. It receives room data and edit/delete handlers through props.

`roomService.js` remains the only frontend service layer for room-related API requests.

`global.css` contains the visual styling required for the improved Rooms page layout, form, table, buttons, alerts, empty state, and status badges.

**Important concepts learned:**

- Refactoring means improving code structure without changing behavior.
- Refactoring is different from rewriting.
- Refactoring is safest after a feature already works.
- Component extraction should be done only when it improves readability.
- Too many components too early can make code harder to understand.
- Props allow parent components to pass data and functions to child components.
- Page components should coordinate feature behavior.
- Feature components should render focused parts of the UI.
- Service files should isolate API communication.
- React renderer owns UI, state, forms, and user interaction.
- Electron main process should not contain room API logic or UI logic.
- Backend business rules should not be moved into React or Electron.

**Verification completed or required:**

The following behavior should work after Milestone 12:

- Rooms load from the backend.
- A new room can be created.
- The room list refreshes after creation.
- Existing rooms can be edited.
- The form clearly switches into edit mode.
- Edit mode can be cancelled.
- The room list refreshes after update.
- Rooms can be deleted after confirmation.
- Delete state is visible while deletion is happening.
- Validation messages appear for invalid form input.
- Success messages appear after successful create, update, and delete actions.
- API errors are shown clearly without crashing the page.
- The Rooms page still feels like part of the dashboard layout introduced in Milestone 8.

**What was intentionally not added:**

- No Guests module.
- No Bookings or Stays workflow.
- No finance, history, or settings logic.
- No room availability calculation based on bookings.
- No room image upload.
- No dashboard metrics.
- No backend changes.
- No Electron backend startup.
- No packaging work.
- No global room state.
- No reducers.
- No external state library.
- No custom room hook yet.

**Result:**

Milestone 12 completed the first cleanup pass of the Rooms module. The feature now has clearer structure, better user experience, improved visual consistency, and better separation between page logic, room-specific UI components, reusable UI, and backend service calls.

---

### Frontend Milestone 13: Guests Module Read-Only Foundation

**Status:** Completed
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 13
**Module:** Guests
**Focus Area:** Read-only guest listing through backend API integration

Frontend Milestone 13 introduced the first real foundation of the Guests module in the HelloStay frontend. The purpose of this milestone was to connect the existing protected dashboard Guests page to the FastAPI backend and display guest records in a simple read-only interface.

This milestone continued the architectural pattern already learned from the Rooms module. Instead of placing API logic directly inside the page component, a separate guest service file was created to keep backend communication organized and maintainable.

The backend endpoint used in this milestone was:

`GET /guests`

This endpoint returns a list of guest records containing:

- `id`
- `guest_name`
- `guest_phone_number`
- `guest_address`
- `id_proof_type`
- `id_proof_number`

A new service file was added:

`frontend/src/services/guestService.js`

This file contains the `getGuests()` function, which calls the backend through the existing `apiClient.js`. This keeps all guest-related API calls inside the guest service layer and prevents the page component from directly handling raw API request details.

The existing `GuestsPage.jsx` placeholder from the dashboard area was updated into a working read-only page. The page now uses React state to manage:

- guest records
- loading state
- error state

The page uses `useEffect` to fetch guests when the component first loads. This means the guest list is requested automatically when the user opens the Guests page.

The Guests page now handles the main API UI states:

- Loading state while guest data is being fetched
- Error state if the backend request fails
- Empty state if no guests are available
- Success state when guest records are returned and displayed

Guest records are displayed in a clean, simple, read-only UI consistent with the HelloStay V1 design direction. The guest display includes useful guest information such as guest name, phone number, ID proof type, ID proof number, and address. A simple initials/avatar placeholder may be used to make the guest cards more readable and visually clear.

No create, edit, delete, modal, form, stay history, booking integration, guest timeline, document upload, OCR, finance, history, settings, Electron backend startup, or packaging logic was added in this milestone.

This milestone respected the responsibility separation of the HelloStay architecture:

- FastAPI remains responsible for guest data, validation, database operations, and API contracts.
- React is responsible for displaying the Guests page and managing UI state.
- `guestService.js` is responsible for guest-related API calls.
- `apiClient.js` remains responsible for common request handling.
- Electron main process is not involved in guest data fetching.

This milestone successfully established the read-only Guests module foundation and prepared the project for future guest creation, editing, deletion, and guest-stay integration milestones.

---

### Frontend Milestone 14: Guests Module Create Foundation

**Status:** Completed
**Milestone:** Frontend Milestone 14 — Guests Module Create Foundation
**Project:** HelloStay — Offline Hotel Management System

Frontend Milestone 14 added the create foundation for the Guests module. This milestone continued directly from the Milestone 13 read-only Guests module and introduced the ability to create new guest records from the React frontend using the existing FastAPI backend.

The goal of this milestone was not to build the full Guests module. The milestone focused only on adding a beginner-friendly, production-oriented create flow while keeping the backend as the source of truth for guest data, validation, database operations, and duplicate constraints.

The existing `GuestsPage.jsx` was preserved and extended instead of being rebuilt from scratch. A new guest creation form was added to the Guests page using controlled React form inputs. The form collects the required guest fields expected by the backend:

- `guest_name`
- `guest_phone_number`
- `guest_address`
- `id_proof_type`
- `id_proof_number`

The `guestService.js` file was updated with a new `createGuest(guestData)` function. This function sends a `POST /guests` request through the existing `apiClient.js`, keeping all guest-related API communication inside the service layer.

The Guests page now supports:

- Fetching existing guests from the backend
- Displaying loading, error, empty, and success states
- Entering guest details through a controlled form
- Basic frontend validation for required fields
- Submitting guest data to the backend
- Showing creation errors clearly
- Clearing the form after successful guest creation
- Refreshing the guest list after a new guest is created

A React Hooks ESLint issue appeared during the milestone because `loadGuests()` was called inside `useEffect`, and that function immediately triggered synchronous state updates. The implementation was corrected by separating pure guest fetching from state-updating logic. A `fetchGuests()` function was introduced to only fetch and return data, while state updates were handled after the asynchronous request completed. This kept the code aligned with React Hooks linting expectations and improved the structure of the data-fetching logic.

This milestone also reinforced important frontend concepts:

- Controlled components
- `useState` for form data
- `useEffect` for initial data loading
- Form submission using `onSubmit`
- `event.preventDefault()`
- Client-side validation
- Backend validation as the final source of truth
- Service-layer API organization
- Refetching data after create operations
- Avoiding direct state mutation
- Avoiding premature abstraction

Electron responsibilities did not change in this milestone. Guest creation remains a renderer process concern that communicates with the FastAPI backend through the frontend service layer. No guest business logic was moved into Electron main process, preload scripts, or IPC.

This milestone intentionally did not add guest edit, guest delete, guest stay history, booking integration, ID document upload, OCR, advanced filtering, pagination, sorting, finance, history, or settings logic.

**Files affected:**

- `frontend/src/services/guestService.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/GuestsPage.jsx`

**Outcome:**

The Guests module can now create new guest records through the backend, clear the form after successful creation, and refresh the guest list so the newly created guest appears in the UI.

---

### Frontend Milestone 15: Guests Module Edit and Delete Foundation

**Status:** Completed
**Date Completed:** 2026-07-15

Milestone 15 extended the HelloStay Guests module with the foundational ability to update and delete existing guest records through the FastAPI backend.

The implementation continued from the completed Guests module created in Milestones 13 and 14. The existing guest loading and creation behavior was preserved instead of rebuilding `GuestsPage.jsx` from scratch.

**Completed work:**

- Reviewed and extended the existing Milestone 14 Guests page.
- Added `updateGuest(guestId, guestData)` to `guestService.js`.
- Added `deleteGuest(guestId)` to `guestService.js`.
- Integrated `PUT /guests/{guest_id}` through the shared API client.
- Integrated `DELETE /guests/{guest_id}` through the shared API client.
- Kept all guest-related HTTP operations inside `guestService.js`.
- Added an Edit action to each displayed guest.
- Added selected guest state for identifying the guest being edited.
- Added separate controlled edit-form state.
- Pre-filled the edit form using the selected guest’s current values.
- Added edit-form change handling.
- Added edit cancellation behavior.
- Added frontend validation for all required guest fields.
- Added normalization and trimming of edited guest data.
- Added comparison between original and edited values.
- Added partial update payload construction containing only changed fields.
- Prevented unnecessary update requests when no values changed.
- Added update loading state.
- Added update error state.
- Displayed backend update errors when available.
- Refetched the guest list after a successful update.
- Added a Delete action to each displayed guest.
- Added beginner-friendly inline delete confirmation.
- Added delete cancellation behavior.
- Added per-guest deletion loading state.
- Added delete error handling.
- Refetched the guest list after successful deletion.
- Closed edit mode when the currently edited guest was deleted.
- Preserved the existing create-guest workflow.
- Kept the UI aligned with the desktop-first HelloStay dashboard design.

**Guest update flow:**

The completed update workflow is:

```text
User selects Edit
        ↓
Selected guest is stored in editingGuest
        ↓
Current guest values are copied into editFormData
        ↓
User edits controlled inputs
        ↓
Frontend normalizes and validates the values
        ↓
Changed values are compared with the original guest
        ↓
PUT /guests/{guest_id} is sent
        ↓
FastAPI updates the database record
        ↓
Guests are refetched
        ↓
Edit mode closes
```

The original guest object and editable form state remain separate. This prevents direct mutation of the guest list and allows the user to cancel editing safely.

**Guest delete flow:**

The completed delete workflow is:

```text
User selects Delete
        ↓
Inline confirmation appears
        ↓
User confirms or cancels
        ↓
DELETE /guests/{guest_id} is sent after confirmation
        ↓
FastAPI deletes the database record
        ↓
Guests are refetched
        ↓
Confirmation state closes
```

Deletion is not performed from the first click because it is a destructive action.

**Validation completed:**

The edit form validates the following required fields:

- `guest_name`
- `guest_phone_number`
- `guest_address`
- `id_proof_type`
- `id_proof_number`

Whitespace is removed before validation and submission.

Frontend validation provides immediate feedback, while FastAPI remains responsible for authoritative validation, uniqueness rules, and database operations.

**State introduced or extended:**

The Guests page now manages separate state for:

- Loaded guest records
- Initial loading
- Guest-loading errors
- Create form data
- Create loading and errors
- Selected editing guest
- Edit form data
- Edit validation errors
- Update loading and errors
- Active delete confirmation
- Guest currently being deleted
- Delete errors

Separating these states prevents one operation from incorrectly controlling another operation’s UI.

**Service-layer changes:**

`guestService.js` now provides the complete guest CRUD foundation required so far:

- `getGuests()`
- `createGuest(guestData)`
- `updateGuest(guestId, guestData)`
- `deleteGuest(guestId)`

The page does not contain hardcoded backend URLs or direct `fetch()` calls.

**Frontend behavior verified:**

The completed module supports:

- Loading existing guests.
- Creating new guests.
- Opening edit mode.
- Pre-filling current guest data.
- Cancelling edit mode.
- Validating edited data.
- Updating one or more fields.
- Detecting submissions with no changes.
- Showing update progress.
- Showing update failures.
- Persisting updates after refresh.
- Opening inline delete confirmation.
- Cancelling deletion.
- Confirming deletion.
- Showing delete progress.
- Showing delete failures.
- Persisting deletion after refresh.

**Architecture responsibilities preserved:**

**React renderer process:**

- Displays guest records.
- Manages forms and controlled inputs.
- Manages edit selection.
- Manages loading and error UI.
- Manages inline delete confirmation.
- Calls guest service functions.

**Service layer:**

- Defines guest update and delete requests.
- Hides endpoint and HTTP-method details from the page.
- Uses the shared API client.

**FastAPI backend:**

- Finds guest records.
- Validates update data.
- Applies partial updates.
- Enforces database constraints.
- Commits updates and deletions.
- Returns success or error responses.

**Electron:**

- No guest business logic was added to the Electron main process.
- No guest API calls were added to preload scripts.
- Electron continues to act only as the desktop shell.

**Files changed:**

- `frontend/src/services/guestService.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/GuestsPage.jsx`
- Existing stylesheet containing guest-related styles

**Not included in this milestone:**

- Guest stay history
- Booking or stay integration
- Guest activity timelines
- ID document uploads
- OCR
- Pagination
- Sorting
- Advanced filtering
- Optimistic updates
- Modal infrastructure
- Finance logic
- History module logic
- Electron backend startup
- Desktop packaging

**Result:**

The Guests module now has a complete basic CRUD foundation:

```text
Create + Read + Update + Delete
```

Guest mutations pass through the established frontend service layer, are confirmed by the FastAPI backend, and are followed by a guest-list refetch. The implementation remains readable, beginner-friendly, and consistent with the architecture established in earlier HelloStay frontend milestones.

**Suggested next milestone:**

Milestone 16 should focus on Guests Module UX Refinement and Code Cleanup.

Recommended areas include:

- Reviewing the size and readability of `GuestsPage.jsx`.
- Extracting guest-specific components only where they simplify the page.
- Reusing a shared `GuestForm` for create and edit if the resulting prop design remains clear.
- Improving action-button variants and destructive-action styling.
- Improving field-level validation presentation.
- Improving loading, empty, and mutation feedback.
- Preserving the existing API behavior without adding guest stays or booking integration.

### Frontend Milestone 16 — Guests Module UX Refinement and Code Cleanup Progress

**Status: completed**

**Milestone Objective**

Improve the completed Guests module while preserving all existing guest CRUD behavior.

The milestone focuses on code clarity, operation-specific state management, UI consistency, validation feedback, accessibility, and safe refactoring.

It does not introduce GuestStay integration, bookings, stay history, pagination, file uploads, OCR, or new backend endpoints.

**Work Completed**

The current Guests module and related frontend files were reviewed, including:

- `GuestsPage.jsx`
- `guestService.js`
- `apiClient.js`
- shared `Input`, `Button`, `Card`, and `ErrorMessage` components
- guest-related styles in `global.css`

The review confirmed that:

- guest API operations remain centralized in `guestService.js`
- the service uses the correct guest endpoints
- creation sends all required guest fields
- updates send only changed fields
- guest cards use stable database IDs as React keys
- edit cancellation safely clears edit state
- deletion requires explicit confirmation
- create, update, and delete operations use separate loading and error states

**Collection Error-State Refinement**

The previous general guest-list error state was divided into:

- `loadError`
- `refreshError`

`loadError` now represents failure of the initial `GET /guests` request.

`refreshError` now represents failure of a later guest-list refresh after a successful create, update, or delete operation.

The guest-list rendering condition now depends on `!loadError` and does not depend on `!refreshError`.

This ensures that a failed refresh does not hide previously loaded guest records.

**Create Behavior**

Before creating a guest:

- the create loading state begins
- the previous create error is cleared
- an old refresh warning is cleared

After successful creation:

- the create form is cleared
- the guest collection is refreshed

When creation succeeds but refreshing fails:

- creation is still treated as successful
- a non-blocking refresh warning is displayed
- the existing guest collection remains visible

**Update Behavior**

Before updating a guest:

- the update loading state begins
- update errors are cleared
- edit validation errors are cleared
- an old refresh warning is cleared

After successful update:

- edit mode closes
- edit-form state is cleared
- the guest collection is refreshed

When updating succeeds but refreshing fails:

- the update is not incorrectly reported as failed
- a non-blocking refresh warning is displayed
- the existing guest collection remains visible

**Delete Behavior**

Before deleting a guest:

- the active guest ID is stored
- delete errors are cleared
- an old refresh warning is cleared

After successful deletion:

- delete confirmation closes
- matching edit state is cleared when necessary
- the guest collection is refreshed

When deletion succeeds but refreshing fails:

- deletion remains successful
- a non-blocking refresh warning is displayed
- the previously loaded collection remains visible until a later successful refresh

**Initial-Load Behavior**

When FastAPI is not running:

- the API client produces a readable backend connection message
- the loading state ends
- the message is stored in `loadError`
- the blocking load error is displayed
- the empty state is not displayed

When FastAPI is running:

- `GET /guests` succeeds
- guests are displayed normally
- collection-level errors are cleared

**Verification Completed**

The following cases have been tested successfully:

- backend unavailable during initial loading
- backend available during initial loading
- correct rendering of the blocking load error
- correct prevention of an inaccurate empty state during backend failure
- successful guest update before a simulated refresh failure
- correct display of a non-blocking refresh warning
- preservation of existing guest cards during the refresh warning
- removal of temporary refresh-failure simulation code

**Architecture Boundaries Preserved**

React continues to own:

- guest page rendering
- controlled form state
- loading states
- validation feedback
- edit selection
- deletion confirmation
- collection error presentation

`guestService.js` continues to own:

- `GET /guests`
- `POST /guests`
- `PUT /guests/{guest_id}`
- `DELETE /guests/{guest_id}`

FastAPI remains responsible for:

- guest validation
- guest business rules
- database operations
- API contracts
- persistent guest data

Electron main and preload processes contain no guest CRUD logic.

**Remaining Milestone 16 Work**

Before Milestone 16 can be marked fully complete, the following planned work remains:

- add field-specific validation to the create form
- make create and edit validation presentation consistent
- consider extracting the duplicated guest form into `GuestForm.jsx`
- consider extracting substantial guest-card markup into `GuestCard.jsx`
- improve create, edit, cancel, and delete button hierarchy
- add or correct missing guest-specific CSS selectors
- clean directly related duplicate CSS without rewriting unrelated styles
- improve operation-specific control disabling
- improve shared input and error accessibility
- verify duplicate phone-number feedback
- verify duplicate ID-proof-number feedback
- complete the full create, edit, delete, browser, Electron, route-regression, and ESLint verification matrix

**Current Outcome**

The Guests module now handles collection failures more accurately and resiliently.

Initial loading failures remain blocking, while later refresh failures preserve existing guest data and provide clear non-blocking feedback.

This completes the collection error-state refinement portion of Frontend Milestone 16.

### Frontend Milestone 17 — Stays Module Read-Only Foundation

**Status:** Completed

#### Objective

Introduce the first functional read-only frontend view for hotel Stay records and connect the protected Stays page to the existing FastAPI backend.

#### Completed Work

- Confirmed that the project already used consistent Stay terminology.

- Confirmed that no duplicate `BookingsPage.jsx` or `/bookings` route existed.

- Confirmed that the sidebar already linked to:

  `/dashboard/stays`

- Confirmed that `StaysPage.jsx` was registered as a protected nested dashboard route.

- Created `src/services/stayService.js`.

- Added `getStays()` to the Stay service.

- Connected `getStays()` to the backend endpoint:

  `GET /stay`

- Kept all Stay-related HTTP communication inside `stayService.js`.

- Reused the existing centralized `apiClient.js`.

- Did not call `fetch()` directly from `StaysPage.jsx`.

- Replaced the static Stays placeholder with a functional read-only page.

- Added page-level state for:
  - Stay records
  - Initial loading state
  - Initial loading error

- Used `useEffect` to request Stay records when the page mounts.

- Kept the `useEffect` callback synchronous and declared the asynchronous loading function inside it.

- Added a cleanup guard to prevent obsolete asynchronous results from updating state after the component unmounts.

- Verified that the backend response is an array before storing or rendering it.

- Added explicit rendering for:
  - Loading state
  - Backend or network error state
  - Empty Stay list
  - Successful Stay list

- Displayed Stay records in a desktop-oriented table.

- Used `stay_id` as the React list key.

- Displayed:
  - Stay ID
  - Room reference
  - Stay status
  - Check-in date and time
  - Check-out date and time
  - Historical price per night

- Displayed `Room ID: <id>` as the safe room-reference fallback.

- Displayed `Not checked out` when `check_out_datetime` is null.

- Added safe handling for missing or invalid date values.

- Formatted dates and times for human-readable display without changing the raw backend data.

- Formatted price values without introducing a hardcoded currency symbol.

- Displayed the backend-owned `stay_status` value directly.

- Added restrained visual badges for:
  - Checked In
  - Checked Out

- Kept unknown backend status values readable with the default badge appearance.

- Added horizontal overflow protection for the Stay table.

- Added a minimum table width to preserve readable operational columns.

- Reused the existing Card, Loading, ErrorMessage, empty-state, and status-badge UI foundations.

- Added only the Stay-specific CSS required for the read-only table.

- Verified the page in the browser and Electron desktop shell.

- Confirmed that existing Rooms, Guests, authentication, logout, and protected routing behavior remained unaffected.

#### Data Flow

```text
StaysPage
    ↓
getStays()
    ↓
stayService.js
    ↓
apiRequest("/stay")
    ↓
FastAPI GET /stay
    ↓
Stay records
    ↓
Loading / Error / Empty / Success UI
```

#### Files Created

```text
frontend/src/services/stayService.js
```

#### Files Updated

```text
frontend/src/pages/StaysPage.jsx
frontend/src/styles/global.css
```

The existing route and layout files were inspected but did not require changes:

```text
frontend/src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx
frontend/src/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx
```

#### Important Technical Concepts Practised

- Master data versus transactional data
- Stay records as operational hotel transactions
- Historical nightly-price snapshots
- Foreign-key references through `room_id`
- Nullable checkout timestamps for active Stays
- Service-layer boundaries
- React `useState`
- React `useEffect`
- Asynchronous request handling
- Effect cleanup and obsolete-result protection
- Loading, error, empty, and success states
- Conditional rendering
- List rendering with stable keys
- API-response validation
- Null-safe rendering
- JavaScript Date parsing
- `Intl.DateTimeFormat`
- `Intl.NumberFormat`
- Raw values versus formatted display values
- Derived values instead of unnecessary state
- Status-to-CSS-class mapping
- Accessible semantic tables
- Responsive table overflow inside Electron

#### Verification Completed

- Confirmed the Stays route is protected.
- Confirmed sidebar navigation opens `/dashboard/stays`.
- Confirmed the Stays page renders inside `DashboardLayout`.
- Verified `GET /stay` through the backend.
- Verified the loading state.
- Verified the backend-unavailable error state.
- Verified an empty Stay response.
- Verified an active Stay with a null checkout timestamp.
- Verified a checked-out Stay.
- Verified multiple Stay records.
- Verified status badge rendering.
- Verified human-readable date and time formatting.
- Verified price formatting.
- Verified non-array response protection.
- Verified table horizontal scrolling.
- Verified the page in the browser.
- Verified the page inside Electron.
- Confirmed Rooms still works.
- Confirmed Guests still works.
- Confirmed login, logout, and protected routing still work.
- Confirmed ESLint and regression checks were completed successfully.

#### Deliberately Deferred

The following features were intentionally excluded from Milestone 17:

- Creating Stay records
- Updating Stay records
- Deleting Stay records
- Check-in actions
- Checkout actions
- Stay lifecycle transitions
- GuestStay API integration
- Guest assignment
- Primary-guest selection
- Guest-name lookup
- Room-number lookup enhancement
- Stay duration calculation
- Billing or total-charge calculation
- Payment tracking
- Room-availability calculation
- Booking conflict validation
- Automatic Room-status changes
- Search, sorting, filtering, and pagination
- A future reservation or Bookings module
- Electron IPC for normal backend requests
- Electron-controlled FastAPI startup
- Desktop packaging

#### Milestone Result

HelloStay now has its first backend-driven read-only view of operational Stay records. The Stays page follows the same service-boundary and request-state principles established by the Rooms and Guests modules while preserving the distinction between master data and transactional hotel data.

---

### Frontend Milestone 18 — Stays Module Create Foundation

#### Objective

Implement the Create Stay foundation for the Stays module.

This milestone extends the existing read-only Stays module by introducing a controlled form that allows users to enter stay information and create a new stay through the existing FastAPI backend.

The milestone focuses only on the creation workflow. Edit and delete functionality are intentionally excluded.

#### Completed Work

- Added Create Stay form to `StaysPage.jsx`.
- Added room selection using rooms retrieved from the backend.
- Added price-per-night input.
- Added check-in date and time input.
- Added stay status selection.
- Added controlled form state using React `useState`.
- Added field-level client-side validation.
- Added stay payload construction before API submission.
- Added `createStay()` integration through `stayService.js`.
- Added submission/loading state using `isSubmitting`.
- Added backend creation error handling.
- Added successful creation feedback.
- Added automatic stay-list refresh after successful creation.
- Added form reset after successful creation.
- Added UX refinements to keep the form consistent with the existing HelloStay interface.

#### Backend Integration

The frontend uses the existing:

`POST /stay`

endpoint.

The request contains:

```text
room_id
price_per_night
check_in_datetime
stay_status
```

The frontend communicates with the backend through the existing service and API-client layers.

```text
StaysPage.jsx
      ↓
stayService.js
      ↓
apiClient.js
      ↓
FastAPI
      ↓
Database
```

FastAPI remains the source of truth for backend validation, business rules, and persistence.

#### Form Validation

The Create Stay form validates:

- Room is required.
- Price per night is required.
- Price must be greater than zero.
- Check-in date and time is required.
- Stay status is required.

Validation errors are stored separately from the form values and displayed next to the corresponding fields.

Client-side validation is intended to improve user experience and does not replace backend validation.

#### Submission Workflow

The completed workflow is:

```text
Enter stay details
        ↓
Submit form
        ↓
Validate form
        ↓
Validation errors?
   ┌────┴────┐
  Yes        No
   ↓          ↓
Show errors  Build payload
               ↓
        Create stay request
               ↓
       Successful response
               ↓
         Refresh stay list
               ↓
           Reset form
               ↓
       Show success message
```

#### Room Integration

The room selector uses the existing `getRooms()` service.

The UI handles:

- Loading rooms.
- Successfully loaded rooms.
- No available rooms.
- Room-loading errors.

The frontend does not maintain a hard-coded list of rooms.

#### Error Handling

The milestone separates different error categories:

- Stay-list loading errors.
- Room-loading errors.
- Field-level validation errors.
- Stay-creation request errors.

This keeps errors associated with the operation that caused them.

#### Success Handling

After successful creation:

1. The stay is created through the backend.
2. The latest stay records are fetched again.
3. The stay table reflects the updated backend state.
4. The form is reset.
5. A success message is displayed.

The frontend does not manually insert the created stay into the existing list.

#### UX Improvements

The Create Stay form follows the existing HelloStay UX.

It uses the application's existing:

- Card layout.
- Form styling.
- Error presentation.
- Button styling.
- Spacing.
- Typography.
- Loading and feedback patterns.

The submit button is disabled while the creation request is in progress and displays an appropriate loading label.

#### Scope Boundary

The following features were intentionally not implemented:

- Stay editing.
- Stay deletion.
- Check-out workflow.
- Stay detail view.
- Advanced stay-management workflows.
- Global state management.

These features remain outside the scope of Milestone 18.

#### Completion Criteria

Milestone 18 is considered complete when:

- The Create Stay form renders correctly.
- Rooms can be selected from backend data.
- Form state works correctly.
- Validation works correctly.
- Invalid submissions are prevented.
- Valid data is submitted to `POST /stay`.
- Submission state works correctly.
- Backend errors are displayed.
- Successful creation is communicated to the user.
- The stay list refreshes after successful creation.
- The form resets after successful creation.
- Existing read-only stay functionality continues to work.
- The form follows the existing HelloStay UX.
- Edit and delete functionality remain excluded.

#### Result

Milestone 18 establishes the **Create foundation for the Stays module**.

The Stays module now supports reading existing stay records and creating new stay records while maintaining the existing React, service-layer, API-client, and FastAPI architectural boundaries.

---

### Frontend Milestone 19 — Stays Module Edit and Delete Foundation

#### Objective

Extend the Stays module beyond read and create operations by implementing the frontend foundation for editing and deleting stay records.

The milestone focuses on connecting the existing Stays UI to the backend `PUT` and `DELETE` operations while maintaining clear separation between UI state, API communication, validation, and backend business logic.

#### Completed Work

- Added stay editing functionality to `StaysPage.jsx`.
- Added an edit form for modifying editable stay fields.
- Added edit-specific form state and validation state.
- Added `isUpdating` state to prevent duplicate update submissions.
- Added update loading feedback through the edit form button.
- Added support for the backend `StayUpdate` contract.
- Added stay deletion functionality to the Stays table.
- Added a delete confirmation UI before performing deletion.
- Added delete-specific state for the selected stay and deletion operation.
- Added deletion loading and error handling.
- Added refresh of the stay list after successful update or deletion.
- Added success and error feedback for stay operations.
- Added button states to prevent repeated submissions while requests are in progress.
- Added CSS required for the newly introduced stay action buttons and related UI.
- Preserved the existing read and create workflows.

#### Edit Workflow

The edit workflow follows this sequence:

1. User selects **Edit** for a stay.
2. The selected stay is stored in component state.
3. Existing editable values are copied into the edit form.
4. The user modifies the editable fields.
5. Client-side validation is performed.
6. A request payload is constructed.
7. `updateStay()` is called from `stayService.js`.
8. The backend processes the `PUT` request.
9. The stay list is refreshed after a successful update.
10. The edit form is closed.
11. A success message is displayed.

#### Editable Stay Fields

The frontend edit form supports the fields defined by the backend `StayUpdate` schema:

- `room_id`
- `price_per_night`
- `check_in_datetime`

The frontend intentionally does not modify `stay_status` or `check_out_datetime` through the edit workflow because those fields are not part of the existing `StayUpdate` contract used for this milestone.

#### Delete Workflow

The delete workflow follows this sequence:

1. User selects **Delete** for a stay.
2. The selected stay is stored in `deletingStay`.
3. A confirmation UI is displayed.
4. The user can cancel the operation.
5. If deletion is confirmed, the frontend calls the stay deletion service.
6. The deletion operation enters a loading state.
7. After successful deletion, the stay list is refreshed.
8. The confirmation UI is closed.
9. A success message is displayed.
10. If deletion fails, an appropriate error is displayed.

#### State Management

The Stays page now maintains separate state for different responsibilities:

- Stay collection state.
- Create form state.
- Create validation state.
- Create submission state.
- Edit form state.
- Edit validation state.
- Edit submission state.
- Selected stay for editing.
- Selected stay for deletion.
- Delete submission state.
- Create/update/delete error states.
- Success message state.
- Room loading and error state.
- Initial stay loading and error state.

This separation keeps unrelated operations from unnecessarily sharing the same state.

#### Validation

The edit form validates:

- Room selection.
- Price per night.
- Check-in date and time.

The existing create validation remains unchanged.

Validation occurs before the API request is made so that obviously invalid input does not unnecessarily reach the backend.

#### API Integration

The Stays module uses the existing service layer:

```text
StaysPage.jsx
      ↓
stayService.js
      ↓
apiClient.js
      ↓
FastAPI backend
```

The service layer remains responsible for communicating with the backend, while `StaysPage.jsx` remains responsible for user interaction and UI state.

#### Backend Contract

The frontend follows the existing backend update contract:

```text
StayUpdate
├── room_id: Optional[int]
├── price_per_night: Optional[Decimal]
├── check_in_datetime: Optional[datetime]
├── check_out_datetime: Optional[datetime]
└── stay_status: Optional[str]
```

For this milestone, the frontend edit workflow sends the editable fields implemented by the current UI:

```text
room_id
price_per_night
check_in_datetime
```

#### Error Handling

The milestone maintains separate error handling for:

- Initial stay loading.
- Room loading.
- Stay creation.
- Stay editing.
- Stay deletion.

Request failures are surfaced to the user instead of silently failing.

#### Loading States

Operation-specific loading states were maintained so that one operation does not incorrectly block unrelated parts of the interface.

Examples include:

- `isLoading`
- `isLoadingRooms`
- `isSubmitting`
- `isUpdating`
- `isDeleting`

Buttons are disabled while their corresponding operation is running to reduce the possibility of duplicate requests.

#### UI and CSS

The Stays module was updated with styling for the newly introduced action controls and operation states.

The styling remains within the existing frontend design system rather than introducing a separate visual system specifically for Stays.

#### Architecture Responsibilities

The milestone preserves the established responsibility boundaries:

```text
React Renderer
├── StaysPage
├── Forms
├── Validation
├── UI State
└── User Interaction
        │
        ▼
Service Layer
├── getStays()
├── createStay()
├── updateStay()
└── deleteStay()
        │
        ▼
API Client
        │
        ▼
FastAPI Backend
├── Validation
├── Business Rules
├── Authorization
└── Database Operations
```

React does not contain hotel business logic, and the backend remains the source of truth.

#### Verification

Milestone 19 was manually verified after implementation.

The following workflows were confirmed to be working:

- Stay loading.
- Stay creation.
- Stay editing.
- Stay deletion.
- Edit cancellation.
- Delete cancellation.
- Loading states.
- Error states.
- Success feedback.
- Stay list refresh after mutations.
- Action button behavior.

#### Completion Status

**Frontend Milestone 19 — Completed.**

The Stays module now has a functional frontend foundation for:

- Read
- Create
- Edit
- Delete

Further Stays-specific refinement or additional workflows should be introduced through a future milestone rather than expanding Milestone 19 retrospectively.

---

### Frontend Milestone 20 — Stays Module CRUD Interaction Refinement

#### Objective

Complete the Stays module CRUD interaction behavior by improving how concurrent edit and delete operations are handled at the individual stay level.

#### Completed Work

- Verified the complete Stays CRUD workflow:
  - Create stay
  - Read/list stays
  - Update stay
  - Delete stay
- Continued using the reusable `StayForm` component for create and edit workflows.
- Maintained client-side validation for create and edit forms.
- Maintained loading, submitting, success, and error states.
- Added row-level update tracking using the stay ID.
- Added row-level delete tracking using the stay ID.
- Prevented editing and deleting the same stay simultaneously.
- Allowed operations on different stays to remain independent.
- Prevented the Edit action for a stay that is currently being deleted.
- Prevented the Delete action for a stay that is currently being edited.
- Added cleanup for stale edit state when the edited stay is deleted.
- Ensured operation state is cleared after successful or failed asynchronous requests.
- Verified that the UI does not unnecessarily lock unrelated stay records.
- Resolved all ESLint errors introduced during the implementation.

#### Final Interaction Behavior

The Stays module now follows row-level operation rules.

A user can perform operations on different stays independently:

```text
Stay A → Updating
Stay B → Deleting
Stay C → Available
```

However, conflicting operations on the same stay are prevented:

```text
Stay A → Updating
Stay A → Delete
        ↓
      Blocked
```

Similarly:

```text
Stay A → Deleting
Stay A → Edit
        ↓
      Blocked
```

#### State Management Improvement

The milestone introduced operation-specific stay IDs so the application can identify exactly which record is being modified.

```text
updatingStayId
      ↓
Identifies the stay currently being updated

deletingStayId
      ↓
Identifies the stay currently being deleted
```

This replaced the earlier behavior where a CRUD operation could unnecessarily affect unrelated stays.

#### Edit State Cleanup

When a stay is successfully deleted, the application checks whether that stay is currently represented by the edit state.

If it is, the edit state is cleared and the edit form disappears.

This prevents stale information from a deleted stay from remaining visible in the UI.

#### Verification

The milestone was manually verified after implementation.

Verified:

- Create operation works.
- Read operation works.
- Update operation works.
- Delete operation works.
- Different stays can be operated on independently.
- The same stay cannot be edited and deleted simultaneously.
- Deleted stays are removed from the displayed list.
- Stale edit state is cleared appropriately.
- Operation states recover correctly.
- No ESLint errors remain.

#### Result

The Stays module now has a complete and more robust CRUD interaction foundation with **row-level asynchronous operation handling** and **same-record conflict protection**.

---

### Frontend Milestone 21 — GuestStay Read-Only Foundation

#### 1. Milestone Overview

**Milestone:** M21
**Name:** GuestStay Read-Only Foundation
**Status:** Completed
**Module:** GuestStay
**Frontend:** React + JavaScript
**Desktop Shell:** Electron
**Backend:** FastAPI

M21 establishes the initial frontend foundation for the **GuestStay** module.

The purpose of this milestone is to provide a read-only view of the relationship between guests and stays. It does not introduce GuestStay creation, editing, deletion, or assignment workflows.

The implementation follows the planned milestone order and does not introduce functionality belonging to later GuestStay milestones.

#### 2. Objective

The objectives of M21 were:

- Introduce the GuestStay frontend service.
- Create the GuestStays page.
- Retrieve GuestStay records from the FastAPI backend.
- Display GuestStay records in a read-only table.
- Handle loading, error, empty, and successful data states.
- Integrate GuestStays into the existing dashboard routing system.
- Add Guest Stays to dashboard navigation.
- Establish reusable table styling.
- Preserve the existing Guests and Stays modules.

#### 3. GuestStay Responsibility

GuestStay represents the relationship between a **Guest** and a **Stay**.

Conceptually:

```text
Guest
  │
  │
  ▼
GuestStay
  │
  │
  ▼
Stay
```

The GuestStay module should therefore not be treated as another copy of the Guests or Stays modules.

Its responsibility is to represent the association between a guest and a stay.

#### 4. Scope Completed

The following functionality was implemented:

- GuestStay API service.
- GuestStays React page.
- GuestStay data retrieval.
- Read-only GuestStay table.
- Loading state.
- Error state.
- Empty state.
- Successful data state.
- Protected dashboard route.
- Dashboard navigation item.
- Shared data-table CSS foundation.
- Responsive horizontal table handling.

#### 5. GuestStay Service

A dedicated service was created:

```text
src/services/guestStayService.js
```

The service is responsible for communicating with the backend GuestStay API.

This maintains separation between:

```text
UI
 │
 ▼
GuestStaysPage
 │
 ▼
guestStayService
 │
 ▼
FastAPI
```

The React page therefore does not need to contain the details of the backend request.

#### 6. GuestStays Page

The page was created at:

```text
src/pages/GuestStaysPage.jsx
```

The page manages the UI state required for the initial read-only implementation.

The main state values are:

```javascript
guestStays;
isLoading;
error;
```

These represent:

- the retrieved GuestStay records,
- whether the initial request is still running,
- whether the request failed.

#### 7. Loading State

While the backend request is running, the page displays the shared `Loading` component.

This gives the user immediate feedback that the application is working instead of displaying an apparently empty page.

#### 8. Error State

If the API request fails, the page displays the shared `ErrorMessage` component.

The implementation also clears the existing GuestStay list when the initial request fails.

This prevents stale or misleading data from being displayed together with an error.

#### 9. Empty State

When the backend successfully returns an empty array, the page displays an empty-state message.

This distinguishes:

```text
No GuestStay records exist
```

from:

```text
GuestStay request failed
```

These are different application states and should not be represented by the same UI.

#### 10. Successful Data State

When GuestStay records are successfully returned, they are displayed in a read-only table.

The table currently displays:

| Field         | Meaning                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| GuestStay ID  | GuestStay relationship identifier      |
| Guest ID      | Associated guest identifier            |
| Stay ID       | Associated stay identifier             |
| Primary Guest | Whether the guest is the primary guest |

The frontend only displays fields supplied by the backend response.

No additional guest or stay information was invented in the UI.

#### 11. React List Rendering

GuestStay records are rendered using JavaScript's `map()` method.

Each row uses the GuestStay identifier as the React key:

```javascript
key={guestStay.id}
```

A stable entity identifier is preferred over an array index because the identifier represents the actual record.

#### 12. Defensive Response Validation

The page verifies that the backend response is an array:

```javascript
if (!Array.isArray(guestStaysData)) {
  throw new Error("Unexpected GuestStay data received from the backend.");
}
```

This provides a defensive boundary between the backend response and the UI.

The frontend should not blindly assume that every response has the expected structure.

#### 13. Async Effect Cleanup

The initial GuestStay request is performed inside `useEffect()`.

A cleanup mechanism prevents an asynchronous result from updating the component after the component has been unmounted.

Conceptually:

```text
Component mounted
      │
      ▼
API request starts
      │
      ├── Component still mounted → update state
      │
      └── Component unmounted → ignore result
```

This is an important pattern when working with asynchronous operations inside React effects.

#### 14. Routing Integration

The GuestStay page was integrated into the protected dashboard route:

```text
/dashboard/guest-stays
```

The existing dashboard routing architecture was preserved.

No separate routing architecture was introduced for GuestStay.

#### 15. Dashboard Navigation

A **Guest Stays** navigation item was added to the dashboard navigation.

This allows users to reach the new module through the normal application navigation structure.

#### 16. Shared Table Styling

Generic table classes were introduced:

```css
.table-wrapper
.data-table
```

The table wrapper provides horizontal overflow handling:

```css
.table-wrapper {
  width: 100%;
  overflow-x: auto;
}
```

The table itself has a minimum width so that its columns remain usable on narrower windows.

The styling was intentionally kept generic so that it can potentially be reused by other data tables.

#### 17. Electron Responsibility

M21 does not require changes to Electron's main process, preload layer, or IPC.

The feature is entirely a renderer-side application feature:

```text
Electron
   │
   ▼
React Renderer
   │
   ▼
GuestStaysPage
   │
   ▼
GuestStay Service
   │
   ▼
FastAPI Backend
```

No backend business logic was moved into Electron or React.

#### 18. Functionality Intentionally Excluded

The following functionality was **not** implemented because it belongs to later GuestStay milestones:

- GuestStay creation.
- Guest assignment workflow.
- GuestStay editing.
- GuestStay deletion.
- Search.
- Filtering.
- Pagination.
- Sorting.
- Advanced GuestStay actions.

Keeping these features outside M21 preserves the planned milestone boundaries.

#### 19. Verification

The completed implementation was manually verified.

The following were confirmed:

- GuestStay route opens correctly.
- Guest Stays navigation works.
- GuestStay records load successfully.
- Read-only table displays correctly.
- Loading behavior works.
- Error behavior works.
- Empty-state behavior works.
- Table remains usable when the Electron window is resized.
- Existing Guests functionality remains unaffected.
- Existing Stays functionality remains unaffected.

#### 20. Engineering Lessons

M21 reinforced several important frontend engineering principles:

1. Components should focus on UI responsibilities.
2. API communication should be separated into services.
3. Loading, error, empty, and success states are all legitimate UI states.
4. Backend response contracts should be respected.
5. React lists require stable keys.
6. Async effects require careful cleanup.
7. Shared UI styles should be reusable where appropriate.
8. Milestones should remain narrowly scoped.
9. Electron should not contain frontend business logic.
10. FastAPI remains the source of truth for backend behavior.

#### 21. Completion Status

**M21 — GuestStay Read-Only Foundation: COMPLETE**

The GuestStay module now has a working read-only frontend foundation and is ready for the next planned GuestStay milestone.

---

### Frontend Milestone 22 — GuestStay Create and Guest Assignment Foundation

#### Status

**Completed**

#### Milestone Objective

Milestone 22 extends the GuestStay module from its read-only foundation into its first write workflow.

The objective was to allow the user to create a GuestStay relationship by selecting:

* An existing Guest
* An existing Stay
* Whether the selected Guest is the Primary Guest

The new relationship is created through the existing FastAPI backend using:

`POST /guest-stays`

The milestone also establishes the required frontend behavior around validation, submission state, success feedback, API errors, list refresh, form reset, and GuestStay form UI refinement.

The implementation continues to follow the backend-contract-first architecture established throughout the frontend rebuild.

#### Starting Point

Milestone 21 established the read-only GuestStay foundation.

Before Milestone 22:

* `GuestStaysPage.jsx` could retrieve GuestStay records.
* `guestStayService.js` exposed `getGuestStays()`.
* GuestStay records were displayed in a read-only table.
* The page handled loading, error, empty, and successful data states.
* GuestStay UI styling had been refined.
* No GuestStay mutation workflow existed.

Milestone 22 builds directly on that foundation rather than replacing it.

#### GuestStay Domain Purpose

GuestStay represents the relationship between Guests and Stays.

The backend architecture defines GuestStay as a junction table supporting:

* Multiple Guests belonging to one Stay.
* One Guest participating in multiple Stays.
* Identification of the Primary Guest for a Stay.

The relationship can therefore be represented as:

```text
Guest
  │
  │
  ▼
GuestStay
  ▲
  │
  │
Stay
```

The frontend must therefore select existing Guest and Stay records rather than creating duplicate Guest or Stay records during GuestStay creation.

This preserves the separation between:

* Guest identity
* Stay records
* Guest–Stay relationships

#### Milestone Scope

The milestone included:

* GuestStay creation.
* Existing Guest selection.
* Existing Stay selection.
* Primary Guest selection.
* `POST /guest-stays` integration.
* Required-field validation.
* Submission/loading feedback.
* Submission error feedback.
* Success feedback.
* GuestStay list refresh after successful creation.
* Form reset after successful creation.
* GuestStay form UI refinement.
* Reuse of existing global UI styles where appropriate.

#### Backend Contract

The GuestStay creation endpoint is:

```text
POST /guest-stays
```

The request body follows the existing backend contract:

```json
{
  "guest_id": 12,
  "stay_id": 7,
  "is_primary_guest": false
}
```

The frontend explicitly sends all three values.

The backend remains responsible for:

* Request validation.
* Database operations.
* Relationship persistence.
* Business rules.
* Final data integrity.

The frontend does not attempt to reproduce backend persistence or relationship logic.

#### Guest Data Integration

The Guest selector obtains Guest records through the existing Guest service:

```text
guestService.js
      ↓
GET /guests
```

Guest records provide:

```text
id
guest_name
guest_phone_number
guest_address
id_proof_type
id_proof_number
```

For GuestStay creation:

* `guest.id` is used as the identifier.
* `guest.guest_name` is displayed to the user.

The GuestStay form does not create or modify Guest records.

#### Stay Data Integration

The Stay selector obtains Stay records through the existing Stay service:

```text
stayService.js
      ↓
GET /stay
```

The Stay response uses:

```text
stay_id
room_id
price_per_night
check_in_datetime
check_out_datetime
stay_status
```

For GuestStay creation:

* `stay.stay_id` is used as the identifier.
* Stay ID, Room ID, and Stay status provide useful selection context.

The implementation correctly uses `stay_id` rather than assuming the Stay object contains an `id` field.

The Stay itself is not modified during GuestStay creation.

#### GuestStay Service

The existing `guestStayService.js` was extended with:

```js
createGuestStay(guestStayData)
```

The service delegates the request to the existing centralized API client.

The resulting service responsibility is:

```text
guestStayService.js

getGuestStays()
createGuestStay()
```

The page does not perform low-level HTTP requests directly.

The communication flow remains:

```text
GuestStaysPage.jsx
        ↓
guestStayService.js
        ↓
apiClient.js
        ↓
FastAPI
        ↓
Database
```

#### Form State

The GuestStay creation form uses React local state.

The form maintains state for:

```text
selectedGuestId
selectedStayId
isPrimaryGuest
```

Additional operation state is maintained for:

```text
isSubmitting
submitError
successMessage
```

This keeps the form values separate from the state describing the status of the API operation.

#### Controlled Inputs

The Guest and Stay `<select>` elements are controlled React inputs.

Their values are connected to React state.

For example:

```text
<select>
     ↓
selectedGuestId
     ↓
React state
```

When the user changes a selection:

```text
User selection
      ↓
onChange event
      ↓
setSelectedGuestId()
      ↓
React state update
      ↓
select displays new value
```

The Primary Guest checkbox follows the same controlled-input principle.

Its checked state is represented by:

```text
isPrimaryGuest
```

#### Identifier Conversion

HTML form controls provide selected values as strings.

The backend expects integer identifiers.

Therefore, immediately before submission, the selected identifiers are converted using:

```js
Number(selectedGuestId)
Number(selectedStayId)
```

The final payload therefore contains numeric IDs:

```js
{
  guest_id: Number(selectedGuestId),
  stay_id: Number(selectedStayId),
  is_primary_guest: isPrimaryGuest,
}
```

This keeps the frontend payload aligned with the backend Pydantic schema.

#### Client-Side Validation

The frontend performs basic required-field validation before making the API request.

The Guest selection is required.

The Stay selection is required.

If no Guest has been selected:

```text
Please select a guest.
```

is displayed and the API request is not made.

If no Stay has been selected:

```text
Please select a stay.
```

is displayed and the API request is not made.

Client-side validation exists for immediate user feedback.

It does not replace backend validation.

FastAPI remains authoritative.

#### Submission Workflow

The completed submission flow is:

```text
User selects Guest
        ↓
User selects Stay
        ↓
User optionally selects Primary Guest
        ↓
Submit
        ↓
Validate required fields
        ↓
Build GuestStay payload
        ↓
createGuestStay()
        ↓
POST /guest-stays
        ↓
Successful response
        ↓
Reload GuestStay collection
        ↓
Update displayed list
        ↓
Reset form
        ↓
Show success message
```

#### Submission Loading State

While GuestStay creation is in progress:

* `isSubmitting` becomes `true`.
* The submit button becomes disabled.
* The button text changes from the normal creation action to an in-progress state.
* Duplicate submissions are prevented.

The button uses the existing HelloStay button styling rather than introducing a new button system.

#### Success Handling

After the backend successfully creates the GuestStay relationship:

1. The GuestStay collection is requested again.
2. The returned collection replaces the current GuestStay state.
3. The selected Guest is cleared.
4. The selected Stay is cleared.
5. Primary Guest selection is reset.
6. A success message is displayed.

The success message communicates that the relationship was created successfully.

#### Why the List Is Refreshed

The implementation deliberately refreshes the GuestStay list after creation rather than manually constructing a new frontend record and appending it to local state.

The flow is:

```text
POST /guest-stays
       ↓
Creation confirmed by backend
       ↓
GET /guest-stays
       ↓
Backend becomes source of displayed collection
```

This keeps the frontend synchronized with the backend.

It also avoids making assumptions about backend-generated values or response behavior.

#### Refresh Helper

The GuestStay retrieval operation used after creation was separated into a small helper:

```js
loadGuestStays()
```

The helper:

* Requests GuestStay records.
* Validates that the response is an array.
* Returns the validated collection.

This allows the post-creation refresh logic to reuse the same response validation without duplicating the request logic.

#### Response Validation

The frontend validates that the GuestStay collection returned from the backend is an array.

If an unexpected response is received, the frontend throws a meaningful error instead of allowing invalid data to reach:

```js
guestStays.map(...)
```

This protects the page from common runtime errors caused by unexpected API responses.

#### Error Handling

GuestStay creation errors are stored separately from the initial page-loading error.

The page therefore distinguishes between:

```text
Initial GuestStay loading
        ↓
error

GuestStay creation
        ↓
submitError
```

This makes the user-facing feedback more accurate.

The API client's existing error-handling behavior remains responsible for converting backend and network failures into usable JavaScript errors.

#### Success and Error Feedback

The form now supports:

```text
Validation error
Submission error
Success message
```

Success feedback uses the existing application alert styling:

```text
alert
alert-success
```

This avoids introducing a separate styling convention for GuestStay notifications.

#### Form Reset

After successful creation, the form is reset.

The following values return to their initial states:

```text
selectedGuestId → ""
selectedStayId → ""
isPrimaryGuest → false
```

The reset occurs only after successful creation and successful GuestStay collection refresh.

This prevents the interface from clearing the user's input when the creation request itself fails.

#### UI Refinement

The GuestStay creation form was refined after its functional behavior was completed.

The refinement focused on consistency with the existing HelloStay UI rather than introducing a new visual system.

The form now uses:

```text
guest-stay-form
```

for overall form spacing.

Individual fields use the existing:

```text
form-field
```

class.

The Primary Guest control uses a dedicated GuestStay-specific class for alignment.

The submit button reuses:

```text
button
button-primary
```

The success message reuses:

```text
alert
alert-success
```

This keeps the GuestStay interface consistent with the rest of the application.

#### Existing CSS Reuse

The milestone intentionally reused existing CSS where possible.

Existing styles for:

* Cards
* Form fields
* Buttons
* Alerts
* Tables
* Empty states

were not unnecessarily duplicated.

Only GuestStay-specific layout styling was introduced where required.

No broad global CSS redesign was performed as part of this milestone.

#### Files Involved

The primary files involved were:

```text
frontend/
└── src/
    ├── pages/
    │   └── guestStaysPage.jsx
    │
    ├── services/
    │   ├── guestStayService.js
    │   ├── guestService.js
    │   └── stayService.js
    │
    └── styles/
        └── global.css
```

The existing `apiClient.js` continued to provide the shared HTTP behavior.

#### React Concepts Practiced

This milestone reinforced:

```text
useState
Controlled inputs
<select>
<input type="checkbox">
onChange
onSubmit
preventDefault()
Conditional rendering
Async event handlers
try/catch/finally
Loading state
Error state
Success state
List rendering
State reset
```

It also reinforced the difference between:

```text
Form state
```

and:

```text
Request state
```

Form state represents what the user has entered.

Request state represents what the application is currently doing.

#### JavaScript Concepts Practiced

The milestone reinforced:

```text
async / await
Promises
try / catch / finally
Objects
Array validation
Number()
Boolean values
Event objects
Function extraction
Reusable async helpers
```

`Number()` is particularly important because HTML form controls return string values even when the underlying backend field is numeric.

#### Existing Architecture Preserved

The milestone did not introduce a new frontend architecture.

It continued the established pattern:

```text
React page
    ↓
Domain service
    ↓
Central API client
    ↓
FastAPI
    ↓
Database
```

The GuestStay page remains responsible for:

* User interaction
* Form state
* Validation feedback
* Loading state
* Error state
* Success state
* Rendering

The GuestStay service remains responsible for:

* GuestStay API operations

The API client remains responsible for:

* HTTP communication
* Request configuration
* Response parsing
* Error conversion

FastAPI remains responsible for:

* Validation
* Business logic
* Database persistence
* Relationship integrity
* Backend truth

#### Electron Boundary

No Electron changes were required.

GuestStay is a normal renderer-to-FastAPI workflow.

The architecture remains:

```text
Electron Main
    ↓
Desktop responsibilities

Preload / IPC
    ↓
Only required for controlled desktop capabilities

React Renderer
    ↓
GuestStay UI and API service calls

FastAPI
    ↓
GuestStay business logic and persistence
```

No GuestStay API calls were moved into Electron main or preload.

#### Important Boundaries

This milestone intentionally did not add:

* GuestStay editing
* GuestStay deletion
* `PUT /guest-stays`
* `DELETE /guest-stays`
* Check-in
* Check-out
* Stay lifecycle transitions
* Booking lifecycle
* Room status automation
* Guest history
* Billing
* Payment processing
* Advanced filtering
* Pagination
* Sorting
* Guest search
* Stay search
* Guest profile creation inside GuestStay
* Stay creation inside GuestStay
* Electron backend startup
* Electron packaging
* New authentication architecture
* Global state management
* Unrelated CSS refactoring

These features remain outside the scope of Milestone 22.

#### Verification Completed

The completed GuestStay workflow was verified for:

* GuestStay page loading.
* Guest records loading into the Guest selector.
* Stay records loading into the Stay selector.
* Guest selection.
* Stay selection.
* Primary Guest selection.
* Required Guest validation.
* Required Stay validation.
* Correct numeric ID conversion.
* Correct GuestStay request payload.
* Successful `POST /guest-stays`.
* Submission/loading feedback.
* Duplicate-submission prevention.
* Success feedback.
* GuestStay list refresh.
* Newly created GuestStay appearing in the list.
* Form reset after successful creation.
* API error handling.
* Refined form styling.
* Existing Guest and Stay functionality remaining unaffected.

#### Regression Considerations

Milestone 22 builds on the existing Rooms, Guests, and Stays modules.

The implementation does not change their backend contracts or service behavior.

The GuestStay page consumes their existing read APIs:

```text
GET /guests
GET /stay
```

and uses their existing identifier structures.

This means the GuestStay workflow remains dependent on valid Guest and Stay records rather than duplicating those entities.

#### Engineering Lessons

Milestone 22 reinforces several important engineering principles.

##### Relationships Should Be Modeled Explicitly

A GuestStay relationship should not be inferred from unrelated Guest or Stay data.

The backend explicitly models the relationship, so the frontend should also explicitly select the two participating entities.

##### The Backend Remains the Source of Truth

The frontend does not decide whether a GuestStay can ultimately be persisted.

It submits the request and uses the backend response as the authoritative result.

##### UI State and Server State Are Different

The selected Guest and selected Stay are temporary UI state.

The actual GuestStay relationship is server/database state.

The frontend should not confuse the two.

##### Refreshing Is Sometimes Better Than Optimistic Updates

After creation, the application requests the authoritative GuestStay collection again.

This is simpler and safer than manually predicting how the server-side collection should look.

##### Small Helpers Can Improve Readability

The `loadGuestStays()` helper removes duplicated retrieval and response-validation logic without introducing a large abstraction.

#### Milestone Result

Milestone 22 successfully establishes the **GuestStay creation and Guest assignment foundation**.

The GuestStay module now supports:

```text
Read GuestStay relationships
        +
Select existing Guest
        +
Select existing Stay
        +
Mark Primary Guest
        +
Create GuestStay relationship
        +
Refresh GuestStay collection
        +
Provide mutation feedback
```

The module now has its first complete read-and-create workflow while preserving the existing separation between Guest identity, Stay records, and GuestStay relationships.

The implementation remains intentionally small and prepares the GuestStay module for future functionality without prematurely introducing lifecycle, editing, deletion, billing, or advanced relationship management.
